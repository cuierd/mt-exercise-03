But how can I <unk> there ( for each thought the other had remained in the palace ) in this miserable condition ? &quot;
The remembrance of Bonnebonne again presented itself to their mind .
It is friendship we invoke in adversity .
They resolved then to have recourse to her kindness .
If they had not themselves known the delights of the Island of Happiness , if they had not been anxious to revisit the scenes of their former felicity , it is so natural to desire a similar habitation , that we often set out in search of it on the description of others .
Each , therefore , turned their steps in the direction of the Island .
It was very easy for them to find the way , they who had once so worthily inhabited it .
They intended to address themselves to one of the columns of which I have spoken , and which conveyed to the ears of the Fairy all the requests of her <unk> .
What was their surprise , or rather what was their delight , to meet with each other again on a spot and in a dress which explained everything !
After the first transports , in which the eye hardly sufficed to satisfy the soul , the first words they uttered were , &quot; Pardon me , I cannot live without you . &quot;
The pardon which is mutually sought is soon granted ; and it was no longer necessary to implore the aid of the Fairy .
The <unk> of their desires had already transported them into the most beautiful spot in the Island .
They were anxious to excuse themselves , and request the forgiveness of Bonnebonne ; but she prevented them .
&quot; I know all that has happened to you , &quot; said she , &quot; I have shared your troubles , although they were deserved .
<unk> the happiness of my empire , you are now better able to appreciate its delights . &quot;
They lived happily because they never ceased to love each other , and they died at the same moment .
Bonnebonne bestowed their names upon two wild flowers &#91; <unk> &#93; in order to immortalize their memory .

&#91; Illustration : The Princess <unk>

THE PRINCESS CAMION .
There was once upon a time a King and Queen who had but one son , who was their only hope .
<unk> years had elapsed from the time of his birth , and the Queen had had no other children .
The Prince was <unk> handsome , and learnt with facility everything they wished him to know .
The King and Queen loved him to <unk> , and their subjects placed all their affections on him , for he was <unk> to everybody , and yet he knew well how to distinguish between the people who approached him .
His name was Zirphil .
As he was an only son , the King and Queen resolved he should marry as early as possible , in order to secure the <unk> to the crown should they <unk> be deprived of Zirphil .
They therefore sought on foot and on horseback a Princess worthy of the <unk> , &#91; <unk> &#93; but none was found suitable .
At length , after a most diligent inquiry , the Queen was informed that a <unk> lady desired a private audience of her Majesty , on business of <unk> .
The Queen immediately ascended her throne in the <unk> , and ordered the lady to be admitted .
The lady approached , without <unk> her white <unk> <unk> , which reached to the ground .
When she arrived at the foot of the throne , &quot; Queen &quot; said she , &quot; I am astonished that , without consulting me , you have thought of marrying your son .
I am the Fairy Marmotte , and my name is sufficiently celebrated to have reached your ears . &quot;
&quot; Ah , Madam , &quot; said the Queen , quickly descending from her throne , in order to embrace the Fairy , &quot; you will easily pardon me my fault when you learn that I have only listened to all the wonders which have been told me about you as to a nursery tale ; but now that you do me the favour to come to my palace , I no longer doubt your power , and beg you will honour me with your advice . &quot;
&quot; That is not a sufficient answer to a Fairy , &quot; replied Marmotte .
&quot; Such an excuse might perhaps satisfy a common person , but I am <unk> offended ; and to begin your punishment , I command you to marry your Zirphil to the person I have brought with me . &quot;
At these words she felt in her pocket , and , drawing out a <unk> case , she opened it , and out of it came a little ivory doll , so pretty and so well made that the Queen , despite her grief , could not help admiring it .
&quot; This is my <unk> , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; and I have always destined her for Zirphil . &quot;
The Queen was bathed in tears .
She conjured Marmotte , in the most touching words , not to expose her to the ridicule of her people , who would laugh at her if she announced to them such a marriage .
&quot; <unk> , indeed , will they , Madam ? &quot;
said the Fairy .
&quot; Ah , we shall see if they have reason to laugh , Madam .
Ah , we shall see if they will laugh at my <unk> , and if your son ought not to adore her .
I can tell you that she deserves to be adored .
She is small , it is true ; but she has more sense than there is in all your kingdom put together .
When you hear her talk , you will be surprised yourself ; for she can talk , I promise you .
Now , then , little Princess Camion , &quot; said she , to the doll , &quot; speak a little to your mother-in-law , and show her what you can do . &quot;
Then the pretty Camion jumped upon the Queen &apos;s _ <unk> _ , &#91; 35 &#93; and paid her a little compliment so tender and so sensible that her Majesty suspended her tears to give the Princess Camion a <unk> kiss .
&quot; Here , Queen , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; is my toothpick-case ; <unk> your daughter-in-law in it .
I wish your son to get well accustomed to her before marrying her .
I think it will not be long first .
Your obedience may soften my anger ; but if you act contrary to my orders , you , your husband , your son , and your kingdom , shall all feel the effect of my wrath .
<unk> all , take care to <unk> her in her case early in the evening , for it is important that she should not be out late . &quot;
At these words she raised her <unk> , and the Queen fainted with fright when she perceived an <unk> live <unk> &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> , <unk> , and as large as a human creature .
Her women came to her assistance , and , when she recovered from her swoon , she saw nothing but the case that Marmotte had left with her .
They put her to bed , and went to inform the King of the accident .
He arrived in a great fright .
The Queen sent every one away , and , with a torrent of tears , she related her adventure to the King , who would not believe it till he saw the doll that the Queen drew from the case .
&quot; Just <unk> ! &quot;
cried he , after having meditated a little , &quot; is it possible that kings should be exposed to such great misfortunes ?
Ah !
we are only placed above other men in order to feel more acutely the cares and <unk> attached to our existence . &quot;
&quot; And in order to give the greater example of fortitude , sire , &quot; added the <unk> , in a small , sweet , and <unk> voice .
&quot; My dear Camion , &quot; said the Queen , &quot; you speak like an oracle . &quot;
At length , after a conversation of an hour between these three persons , it was decided that they should not yet divulge the contemplated marriage , and that they should wait until Zirphil , who was gone hunting for three days , should have returned , and consented to obey the command of the Fairy , which the Queen undertook to <unk> to him .
In the interim , the Queen , and even the King , shut themselves up , in order to converse with the little Camion .
She had a <unk> intellect , she spoke well , and with a singular turn of thought which was very pleasing .
But although she was animated , her eyes had a fixed expression which was not agreeable , and the Queen was annoyed by it , as she began to love Camion , and feared that the Prince might take a dislike to her .
More than a month had elapsed since Marmotte had appeared , but the Queen had not yet dared to show Zirphil his intended .
One day he entered her room whilst she was in bed .
&quot; Madam , &quot; said he , &quot; the most singular thing in the world occurred to me some days since whilst I was hunting .
I had wished to conceal it from you , but at length it has become so extraordinary , that I must positively tell you of it .
&quot; I followed a wild boar with great ardour , and had pursued it into the midst of a forest without observing that I was alone , when I saw him throw himself into a hole which opened in the ground .
My horse having plunged in after it , I continued falling for half an hour , and at length found myself at the bottom , without any hurt .
There , instead of the boar , which I confess I feared to find , I saw a very ugly woman , who begged me to dismount from my horse and follow her .
I did not hesitate , and giving her my hand , she opened a little door which had previously been hidden from my view , and I entered with her a saloon of green marble , where there was a golden bath , covered with a <unk> of very rich stuff ; the <unk> rose , and I saw in the bath a person of such marvellous beauty that I thought I should have fallen to the ground .
<unk> Zirphil , &apos; said the lady , who was bathing , &apos; the Fairy Marmotte has enchanted me , and it is by your assistance alone that I can be released . &apos;
<unk> , Madam , &apos; said I to her : &apos; what must I do to help you ? &apos;
<unk> must either , &apos; said she , &apos; marry me instantly or skin me alive . &apos;
I was as much surprised at the first proposition as alarmed at the second .
She read in my eyes my embarrassment , and said , &apos; Do not imagine that I <unk> , or that I propose to you an act of which you may repent .
No , Zirphil , <unk> your fears ; I am an unfortunate Princess to whom the Fairy has taken an aversion ; she has made me <unk> , <unk> because I would not marry her nephew , the King of the Whiting , who is frightful , and even more wicked than he is hideous .
She has condemned me to remain in my present state until a Prince named Zirphil shall fulfil one of the conditions that I have just proposed to you ; to <unk> this matter , I caused my maid of honour to take the form of a wild boar , and it is she who has led you hither .
I must now tell you that you cannot leave this spot until you shall have fulfilled my desire in one manner or the other .
I am not mistress here ; and Citronette , whom you see with me , will tell you that it cannot be arranged otherwise . &apos;
&quot; <unk> , Madam , &quot; said the Prince to the Queen , who listened attentively , &quot; in what a state this discourse left me . &quot;
Although the face of the Whale-Princess pleased me excessively , and her charms and misfortunes rendered her extremely interesting , her being half a fish horrified me exceedingly ; and the idea of skinning her alive threw me into utter despair .
<unk> , Madam , &apos; said I to her , at length ( for my silence became as stupid as <unk> ) , &apos; is there not a third way ? &apos;
I had hardly uttered those unlucky works , than the Whale-Princess and her attendant uttered shrieks and lamentations which were enough to pierce the <unk> roof of the saloon .
<unk> <unk> !
cruel tiger !
and everything that is most ferocious and most inhuman ! &apos;
exclaimed the former .
<unk> wouldst , then , that I should also be condemned to the torture of seeing you expire ?
For if thou dost not resolve to grant my request , the Fairy has assured me thou wilt perish , and I shall remain a whale all my life ! &apos;
&quot; Her reproaches pierced my heart ; she raised her beautiful arms out of the water , and joined her charming hands to implore me to decide quickly .
Citronette was at my knees , which she embraced , <unk> loud enough to <unk> me .
<unk> how can I marry you ? &apos;
said I ; &apos; what sort of ceremony can be performed ? &apos;
<unk> me , &apos; said she tenderly , &apos; and do not marry me , I prefer that . &apos;
<unk> her ! &apos;
<unk> the other , &apos; and fear nothing . &apos;
I was in a state of <unk> which I cannot describe ; and while I considered what I ought to do , their shrieks and tears were redoubled , till I knew not what would become of me .
At length , after a thousand and one <unk> , I cast my eyes once more on the beautiful <unk> , and I confess that I found in her features an <unk> charm .
I threw myself on my knees close to the bath , and taking her hand , &apos; No , divine Princess , &apos; said I to her ; &apos; I will not skin you , I would rather marry you ! &apos;
&quot; At these words joy lighted up the countenance of the Princess , but a modest joy , for she coloured , and casting down her beautiful eyes , &apos; I shall never forget , &apos; said she , &apos; the service that you render me ; I am so penetrated with gratitude , that you may expect anything of me after this generous resolution . &apos;
<unk> not lose time , &apos; cried the insupportable Citronette ; &apos; tell him quickly all that he must do . &apos;
<unk> is sufficient , &apos; said the Whale-Princess , blushing again , &apos; that you give me your ring , and that you should take mine ; there is my hand , receive it as a <unk> of my faith . &apos;
I had hardly made this tender exchange , and kissed the beautiful hand which she presented to me , when I found myself again upon my horse in the midst of the forest .
Having called my people , they came to me , and I returned home without being able to utter a word , I was so completely astounded .
Since then , I am transported every night without knowing how , into the beautiful green saloon , where I pass the night near an invisible person ; she speaks to me , and tells me that the time is not yet come for me to know who she is . &quot;
&quot; Ah , my son , &quot; interrupted the Queen , &quot; is it possible , then , that you are really married to her ? &quot;
&quot; I am , Madam , &quot; replied the Prince ; &quot; but although I love my wife infinitely , I would have sacrificed this affection if I could have escaped from the saloon without <unk> to that <unk> . &quot;
At these words , a little voice , proceeding from the Queen &apos;s pocket , said , &quot; Prince Zirphil , you should have <unk> her ; perhaps your pity may be fatal to you . &quot;
The Prince , surprised at this voice , remained <unk> .
The Queen in vain tried to conceal from him the cause of his astonishment ; he felt quickly in her pocket , which was hanging upon the <unk> near the bed , and drew from it the toothpick-case , which the Queen took from his hand and opened .
The Princess Camion immediately came out of it , and the astonished Prince threw himself on his knees by the <unk> of the Queen to inspect her nearer .
&quot; I <unk> , Madam , &quot; cried he , &quot; that this is my dear <unk> in miniature .
Is this some <unk> , and have you only wished to <unk> me , by allowing me so long to believe that you would not approve of my marriage ? &quot;
&quot; No , my son , &quot; at length the Queen replied ; &quot; my grief is real , and you have exposed us to the most cruel misfortunes by marrying that <unk> , for , in fact , you were promised to the Princess Camion whom you see in my hands . &quot;
She then related to him what had passed between her and the Fairy Marmotte , and the Prince allowed her to say all she wished without interruption , so much was he astonished to find that she and his father had agreed to a proposition which was , on the face of it , so ridiculous .
&quot; Heaven forbid , Madam , &quot; said he at length , when the Queen had finished , &quot; that I should ever oppose the designs of your Majesty , or that I should act contrary to the wish of the King , my father , even when he commands me to do anything as impossible as this appears to me to be ; but had I consented , could I even have fallen in love with this pretty Princess , would your subjects ever <unk> &quot; &quot; Time is a great <unk> , Prince Zirphil , &quot; interrupted Camion ; &quot; but it is done ; you cannot now marry me , and my godmother appears to me a person who will not patiently suffer any one to break their word with her .
<unk> as I am , I feel as acutely as the largest woman would the disagreeable nature of this adventure ; but as you are not so much to blame , except perhaps for having been a little too hasty , I may persuade the Fairy to mitigate the punishment . &quot;
After these words Camion was silent , for she was exhausted with having said so much .
&quot; My dear darling , &quot; said the Queen , &quot; I implore you to take some repose for fear you should be ill and not in a condition to speak to the Fairy when she comes to afflict us ; you are our consolation , and however she may punish us , I shall not feel it so deeply if Marmotte does not take you from us . &quot;
The Princess Camion felt her little heart beat at these words of the Queen : but being quite overcome , she could only kiss her hand , and let fall upon it some tiny tears .
Zirphil was moved at this incident , and begged Camion to permit him to kiss her hand in his turn : she gave it him with much grace and dignity , and then re-entered her case .
After this tender scene the Queen rose , in order to go and tell the King what had passed , and take every <unk> precaution against the anger of the Fairy .
The following night Zirphil , in spite of the guard which they had <unk> in his apartment , was carried off at midnight , and found himself , as usual , in the company of his invisible wife ; but instead of hearing any of those sweet and touching things which she was accustomed to say to him , he heard her weep , and found she kept <unk> from him .
&quot; What have I done ? &quot;
said he at last , when quite tired of pursuing her .
&quot; You weep , dear Princess , when you ought to console me for all the peril I may have incurred , as the effect of my tenderness . &quot;
&quot; I know all , &quot; said the Princess , with a voice interrupted by <unk> &quot; I know all the misery that may happen to me ; but , ungrateful man !
it is of you I have most to complain . &quot;
&quot; Oh , heavens ! &quot;
cried Zirphil , &quot; what have you to reproach me with ? &quot;
&quot; The love which Camion bears to you , &quot; replied the voice , &quot; and the tenderness with which you have kissed her hand . &quot;
&quot; The tenderness , &quot; replied the Prince , quickly ; &quot; oh !
divine Princess , do you know so little of that I feel for you as to accuse me so lightly .
Besides , even if Camion could love me , which is impossible , as she only saw me for a moment , can you be alarmed , knowing my love for you , and after the proofs which I have given you of my attachment ?
It is you whom I should accuse of injustice : for if I have looked at her with any attention , it is because her features reminded me of yours , and that being deprived of the pleasure of beholding you , anything which resembled you gave me the greatest gratification .
Be visible again , my dear Princess , and I will never look on any other woman . &quot;
The invisible lady appeared to be consoled by these words , and approaching the Prince , said , &quot; Pardon me this little movement of jealousy .
I have too much reason to fear they will separate me from you , not to feel afflicted by a circumstance which appeared to me to announce the commencement of that misfortune . &quot;
&quot; But , &quot; said the Prince , &quot; may I not know why you are no longer permitted to show yourself ?
For if I have delivered you from the tyranny of Marmotte , how is it possible that you should be again subjected to it ? &quot;
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
said the invisible Princess , &quot; if you had decided to <unk> me we should have been very happy ; but you had such a horror of that proposition , that I did not dare press you further on the subject . &quot;
&quot; By what chance , &quot; interrupted the Prince , &quot; was Camion informed of this adventure , for she told me nearly the same thing ? &quot;
Hardly had he finished these words , when the Princess uttered a frightful <unk> .
The Prince , in surprise , rose hastily .
But what was his alarm when , in the middle of the apartment , he perceived the hideous Marmotte , who held by the hair the beautiful Princess , now no longer either half a whale or invisible !
He was about to seize his sword when the Princess , in tears , begged him to moderate his anger , for it would be of no avail against the power of the Fairy ; and the horrible Marmotte , <unk> her teeth , emitted through them a blue flame which <unk> his beard .
&quot; Prince Zirphil , &quot; said she to him , &quot; a fairy who <unk> thee prevents me from <unk> thee , thy father , thy mother , and all that belong to thee : but thou shalt suffer at least in all that is most dear to thee , for having married without having consulted me , and thy torment shall never finish , nor that of thy Princess , until thou shalt have obeyed my commands . &quot;
In <unk> these words the Fairy , the Princess , the chamber , and the palace , all disappeared together , and he found himself in his own apartment , in his <unk> , and his sword in his hand .
He was so astonished , and so transported with rage , that he did not feel the severity of the cold , though it was in the <unk> of winter .
At the noise which he made his guards entered the room and begged him to go to bed , or to allow them to dress him .
He took the latter course , and went to the Queen &apos;s chamber , who , on her part , had passed the night in the most cruel state of anxiety .
She had not been able to sleep after going to bed , and in order to induce slumber she had wished to talk over her grief with little Camion ; but she sought in vain for her in her case : Camion was no longer there .
She feared she might have lost her in the garden : she rose , and having ordered <unk> to be lighted , went in search of her , but without <unk> had entirely disappeared , and the Queen retired to bed again in an alarming state of affliction ; she gave fresh vent to it as her son entered .
He was so distressed himself that he did not perceive the tears of the Queen .
She , on her part , observing his agitation , exclaimed , &quot; Ah !
without doubt , you have come to announce to me some dreadful tidings ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , Madam , &quot; replied the Prince ; &quot; I come to tell you that I shall die if I do not find my Princess . &quot;
&quot; How ! &quot;
said the Queen ; &quot; do you already , my dear son , love that unhappy Princess ? &quot;
&quot; What , your Camion ? &quot;
said the Prince : &quot; can you suspect me , Madam , of such a thing ?
I speak of my dear Whale-Princess who has been torn from me ; it is for her alone that I live , and it is Marmotte , the cruel Marmotte , who has carried her away ! &quot;
&quot; Ah , my son , &quot; said the Queen , &quot; I am far more unhappy than you , for if they have taken your Princess away from you , they have robbed me of my Camion .
Since last evening , she has disappeared from her case ! &quot;
They then related to each other their <unk> adventures , and wept together over their common misfortunes .
The King was informed of the cries and despair of the Queen , and the grief of his son .
He entered the apartment in which this <unk> scene was passing , and as he was an exceedingly clever man , the thought occurred to him immediately of <unk> Camion , with the offer of a large reward to <unk> should bring her back .
Everybody agreed this was a capital idea , and even the Queen , in spite of her great grief , was obliged to confess that no one of ordinary <unk> could have imagined so singular an <unk> .
The <unk> were printed , and distributed , and the Queen became rather calm in the hope of soon hearing some tidings of her little Princess .
As for Zirphil , the loss of Camion interested him no more than her presence ; he resolved to seek a fairy of whom he had heard speak .
He asked permission of the King and Queen , and departed with a single equerry in attendance on him .
It was a great distance from that country to the one inhabited by the Fairy ; but neither time nor obstacles could check the fond impatience of the youthful Zirphil .
He passed through states and kingdoms without number : nothing particular happened to him because he did not desire it ; for being handsome as Cupid and <unk> as his own sword , he would have had no lack of adventures had he sought for them .
At length , after a year &apos;s travelling , he arrived at the commencement of the desert wherein the Fairy had fixed her abode ; he dismounted from his horse , and left his equerry in a little cottage , with orders to await him there , and not to be impatient .
He entered the desert , which was frightful from its solitude ; <unk> alone inhabited it , but their cries did not alarm the <unk> spirit of our Prince .
One evening , he perceived at a distance a light which made him think he was approaching the grotto ; for who but a fairy could live in such a horrible desert .
He walked all night long ; at length , at break of day , he discovered the famous grotto ; but a lake of fire separated him from it , and all his valour could not protect him from the flames , which spread right and left .
He looked about for a long time to see what he could do , and his courage nearly failed him when he found that there was not even a bridge .
<unk> proved his best friend , for in a <unk> of love and anguish , he resolved to end his days in the lake , if he could not traverse it .
No sooner had he taken this strange resolution than he put it in execution , and throwing himself <unk> into the flames , he felt a little gentle <unk> which did not even inconvenience him , and passed without the least trouble to the other side .
Hardly had he landed , when a young and beautiful Salamander emerged from the lake , and said , &quot; Prince Zirphil , if your love be as great as your courage , you may hope for everything from the Fairy Lumineuse ; she favours you , but she wishes to prove you . &quot;
Zirphil made a profound bow to the Salamander in acknowledgment , for she did not give him time to speak ; she plunged again into the flames , and he pursued his way .
He arrived at length at the foot of a rock of prodigious height , which from its great brilliancy appeared all on fire .
It was a <unk> , so large that the Fairy was very <unk> lodged in the inside .
As soon as the Prince approached , Lumineuse came out of the rock ; he <unk> himself before her , she raised him , and made him enter the grotto .
&quot; Prince Zirphil , &quot; said she , &quot; a power equal to mine has <unk> the benefits I bestowed on you at your birth ; but you may hope for everything from my care .
It <unk> as much patience as courage to <unk> the wickedness of Marmotte ; I can tell you nothing more . &quot;
&quot; At least , madam , &quot; replied the Prince , &quot; do me the favour to inform me if my beautiful Princess is unhappy , and if I may hope to see her again soon ? &quot;
&quot; She is not unhappy , &quot; replied the Fairy : &quot; but you cannot see her till you have pounded her in the mortar of the King of the Whiting . &quot;
&quot; Oh !
heavens ! &quot;
cried the Prince ; &quot; is she in his power ; and have I to dread not only the consequences of his passion , but the still greater horror of pounding her with my own hands ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> up your courage , &quot; replied the Fairy , &quot; and do not hesitate to obey ; upon that depends all your happiness , and that of your wife . &quot;
&quot; But she will die if I pound her , &quot; said the Prince , &quot; and I would rather die myself . &quot;
&quot; Away , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; and do not <unk> ; each moment that you lose <unk> to the fury of Marmotte .
Go and seek the King of the Whiting ; tell him you are the page I promised to send him , and <unk> on my protection . &quot;
She then pointed out to him on a <unk> the road he must take to reach the dominions of the King of the Whiting ; and took her leave of him , after having informed him that the ring which the Princess had given him would show him all he had to do whenever the King commanded him to execute a difficult task .
He departed , and after some days &apos; travelling arrived in a meadow which stretched down to the sea , to the shore of which was <unk> a small <unk> of mother-of-pearl and gold .
He looked at his ruby , and saw himself in it going on board the vessel .
He therefore stepped into it , and after having cast off , the wind took it out to sea .
After some hours &apos; <unk> , the vessel brought up at the foot of a crystal castle , built upon <unk> <unk> .
He jumped <unk> , and entered a court-yard which led through a magnificent <unk> to apartments without number , the walls of which were of rock crystal , admirably cut , and which produced the most beautiful effect in the world .
The castle appeared to be inhabited only by men with <unk> &apos; heads of all species .
He felt convinced this was the dwelling of the King of the Whiting , and shuddered with rage ; but he <unk> himself so far as to inquire of a <unk> , who had the air of being a <unk> of the guard , how he could manage to see the King of the Whiting .
The <unk> very <unk> made him a signal to advance , and he entered the <unk> , where he saw under arms a thousand men with <unk> &apos; heads , who formed in line for him to pass .
At length , after making his way through an infinite crowd of men-fish , he came to the <unk> .
There was not much noise , for the courtiers were all dumb , the greater part having whiting &apos;s heads .
He saw several who appeared of more consequence than the rest , from the crowd which surrounded them , and by the air which they assumed with the others .
They arrived at the King &apos;s cabinet , out of which he saw the council issue , composed of twelve men who had sharks &apos; heads .
The King at length appeared himself .
He had a whiting &apos;s head , like many of the others ; but he had <unk> on his shoulders , and from his waist <unk> he was a veritable whiting .
He could speak , and wore only a scarf made of the skin of <unk> , which was very brilliant , and a helmet in the form of a crown , out of which arose a <unk> &apos;s tail , which formed the plume .
Four whiting carried him in a bowl of <unk> porcelain , as large as a bath , full of sea water .
His greatest pride consisted in causing it to be filled twice a day by the <unk> and <unk> of his kingdom .
This office was extremely sought after .
The King of the Whiting was very large , and had more the air of a monster than of anything else .
When he had spoken to some of those who had presented him with petitions , he perceived the Prince .
&quot; Who are you , my friend ? &quot;
said he to him .
&quot; By what chance do I see a man here ? &quot;
&quot; My lord , &quot; said Zirphil , &quot; I am the page the Fairy Lumineuse has promised you . &quot;
&quot; I know what she means , &quot; said the King , laughing , and showing his teeth , like those of a saw .
&quot; <unk> him into my <unk> , and let him teach my crayfish to talk . &quot;
Immediately a troop of whiting surrounded him , and conducted him according to the King &apos;s orders .
In returning through the apartments all the fish , even those the highest in favour , professed , by various signs , a great deal of friendship for him .
They led him through a delicious garden , at the end of which was a charming pavilion , built entirely of mother-of-pearl , and ornamented with great branches of coral .
The favourite Whiting introduced him into an apartment similarly adorned , the windows of which overlooked a magnificent piece of water .
They made him understand that that was to be his residence , and after having shown him a little chamber at one corner of the saloon , which he understood was to be his <unk> , they retired , and he remained alone , very much astonished to find himself something very like a prisoner in the palace of his rival .
He was <unk> on this position of affairs , when he saw the doors of the chamber open , and ten or twelve thousand crayfish , conducted by one larger than the rest , entered , and placed themselves in straight lines , which nearly filled the apartment .
The one which marched at their head mounted upon a table near him , and said , &quot; Prince , I know you , and you owe much to my care ; but as it is rare to find gratitude in men , I will not tell you what I have done for you , for fear you should destroy the sentiments with which you have inspired me .
I have only , therefore , to inform you that these are the crayfish of the King of the Whiting , that they alone speak in this empire , and that you are chosen to teach them refined language , the customs of the world , and the means of pleasing their sovereign .
You will find them intelligent ; but you must every morning choose ten to pound in the King &apos;s mortar , to make his broth .
&quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; The <unk> having ceased speaking , the Prince replied , &quot; I had no idea , Madam , that you had interested yourself in my <unk> .
The gratitude I already feel towards you should induce you to abandon the bad opinion you have conceived of men in general , since on the <unk> assurance which you have given me of your friendship , I feel deeply obliged to you .
But what I am very anxious to learn is , the course I should take in <unk> with the persons whose education you would confide to me .
If I were sure that they had as much intellect as you , I should have no trouble , and I should feel a pride in the task ; but the more difficult I should find them to teach , the less should I have the courage to punish them for faults for which they are not <unk> .
And having lived with them , how can I have the heart to deliver them to a torture ? &quot;
&quot; You are <unk> and a great talker , &quot; interrupted the <unk> ; &quot; but we know how to <unk> you . &quot;
So saying , she rose from the table , and jumping to the ground , took her real form of Marmotte ( for she was that wicked fairy ) .
&quot; Oh , heavens ! &quot;
cried the Prince ; &quot; so this is the person who <unk> of the interest she takes in my <unk> who has done nothing but make me miserable .
Ah , Lumineuse , &quot; continued he , &quot; you abandon me ! &quot;
He had hardly finished these words , when Marmotte precipitated herself by the window into the reservoir and disappeared , and he remained alone with the twelve thousand crayfish .
After having meditated a little as to how he should proceed to <unk> them , during which time they waited in complete silence , it occurred to him that he might very probably find amongst them his beautiful and unfortunate Princess , because the hideous Marmotte had ordered him to pound ten of them every morning .
&quot; And why should I be selected to pound them , &quot; said he , &quot; if it be not to drive me distracted ?
Never mind , let us look for her , &quot; continued he , rising ; &quot; let us at least try to recognise her , even if I die of grief before her eyes . &quot;
Then he asked the crayfish if they would kindly permit him to search amongst them for one of his acquaintance .
&quot; We know nothing about it , my Lord , &quot; said the first who spoke ; &quot; but you can make what inquiry you please up to the time of our return to the reservoir , for we must positively pass the night there . &quot;
Zirphil commenced his inspection ; the more he sought , the less he discovered , but he <unk> , from the few words which he drew from those he <unk> , that they were all princesses transformed by the wickedness of Marmotte .
This caused him inconsolable grief , for he had to choose ten for the King &apos;s broth .
When evening came , they repeated that they must retire to the reservoir , and it was not without pain that he <unk> the sweet occupation of seeking the Princess .
He had only been able in the whole day to <unk> a hundred and fifty ; but as he was certain at least that she was not amongst them , he determined to take ten from that number ; he had no sooner chosen them than he proceeded to carry them to the King &apos;s offices ; but he was arrested by the most <unk> <unk> of laughter from the victims he was about to immolate ; he was so surprised by it , that he was some time without speaking ; at length he interrupted them to inquire what it was they found so amusing in their present circumstances ?
They renewed their <unk> of laughter so heartily that he could not help , in spite of his own sorrows , <unk> in their <unk> .
They wanted to speak , but could not for laughing ; they could only <unk> , &quot; Oh , I can say no more ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , I shall die of it ! &quot;
&quot; No , there is nothing in the world so amusing ! &quot;
and then <unk> again .
At length he reached the Palace with them all laughing together , and having shown them to a <unk> man , who seemed to be the principal cook , a mortar of green porphyry , ornamented with gold , was set before him , into which he put his ten crayfish , and prepared to pound them .
At that moment the bottom of the mortar opened , emitted a brilliant flame , which dazzled the Prince , and then <unk> up again , appeared perfectly <unk> ; even the crayfish had vanished .
This astonished , but at the same time gratified him , for he was very <unk> to pound such merry creatures .
The <unk> , on the contrary , seemed sadly distressed at this adventure , and wept bitterly .
The Prince was as much surprised at this as he was at the laughter of the crayfish , and he could not ascertain the cause , as the <unk> <unk> was dumb .
He returned , much disturbed by his adventure , to his pretty apartment , where he no longer found the crayfish , for they had returned to the reservoir .
The following morning , they re-entered without Marmotte ; he sought for his Princess , and still not discovering her , he again chose ten of the finest for pounding .
The same adventure <unk> laughed , and the <unk> wept when they disappeared in the flame .
For three months this extraordinary scene was daily repeated ; he heard nothing of the King of the Whiting , and he was only uneasy at not discovering his beautiful Princess .
One evening , returning from the kitchen to his own apartments , he traversed the King &apos;s gardens , and passing near a <unk> which surrounded a charming <unk> , in the midst of which was a little sparkling fountain , he heard some one speaking ; this surprised him , for he believed all the inhabitants of that kingdom to be as dumb as those he had seen .
He advanced gently , and heard a voice , which said , -- &quot; But Princess , if you do not discover yourself , your husband will never find you . &quot;
&quot; What can I do ? &quot;
said the other voice , which he recognised as that he had so often heard .
&quot; The cruelty of Marmotte <unk> me to remain silent , and I cannot discover myself without <unk> his life as well as my own .
The wise Lumineuse , who <unk> him , <unk> my features from him in order to preserve us to each other : he must absolutely pound me , it is an <unk> sentence . &quot;
&quot; But why should he pound you ? &quot;
inquired the other .
&quot; You have never yet told me your history ; Citronette , your <unk> , would have related it to me had she not last week been chosen for the King &apos;s broth . &quot;
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
replied the Princess , &quot; that unfortunate has already undergone the torture which I await ; would that I were in her place , for assuredly by this time she is in her grotto . &quot;
&quot; But , &quot; rejoined the other voice , &quot; as it is such a beautiful night , tell me now why you are subjected to the vengeance of Marmotte .
I have already told you who I am , and I burn with impatience to know more about you . &quot;
&quot; Although it will renew my grief , &quot; replied the Princess , &quot; I cannot refuse to satisfy you , especially as I must speak of Zirphil , and I take pleasure in all that <unk> to him . &quot;
One may easily judge of the delight which the Prince felt at this fortunate moment ; he <unk> gently into the <unk> , but as it was very dark he saw nothing ; he listened , however , with all his ears , and this is word for word what he heard : -- &quot; My father was King of a country near Mount <unk> ; he reigned to the best of his ability over a people of incredible wickedness ; there were perpetual <unk> , and often the windows of his Palace were broken by the stones which they <unk> against them .
The Queen , my mother , who was a very accomplished woman , composed speeches for him to make to the <unk> ; but if he succeeded in <unk> them one day , the next produced a new trouble .
The judges were tired of <unk> to death , and the <unk> of hanging .
At length things arrived at such a <unk> that my father , seeing all our provinces were uniting against us , resolved to withdraw from the capital , that he might no longer witness so many disagreeable scenes .
He took the Queen with him , and left the kingdom to the government of one of his ministers , who was very wise , and less timid than the King , my father .
My mother was expecting my birth , and travelled with some difficulty to the foot of Mount <unk> , where my father had chosen his habitation .
Our wicked subjects <unk> the <unk> for joy at their departure , and next day <unk> our <unk> , saying that he wished to carry matters with too high a hand , and that they much preferred their old Sovereign .
My father was not at all flattered by their preference , and remained concealed in his little retreat , where very soon I saw the light .
&quot; They named me Camion , because I was so very diminutive .
&#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> , the King and Queen , tired of the honours which had cost them so dear , and wishing to conceal my high birth from me , brought me up as a shepherdess .
At the end of ten years ( which appeared to them like ten minutes , so happy were they in their retreat ) , the fairies of the <unk> , indignant at the wickedness of the people who inhabited our kingdom , resolved to restore order in it .
One day that I was <unk> my sheep in the meadow which <unk> our garden , two old shepherdesses accosted me , and begged me to give them shelter for the night ; they had such a sad <unk> air that my soul was moved with compassion .
<unk> me , &apos; said I ; &apos; my father , who is a farmer , will receive you willingly . &apos;
I ran to the cottage to announce their arrival to him ; he came to meet them , and received them with much kindness , as did my mother also .
I then brought in my sheep , and set milk before our <unk> .
Meanwhile , my father prepared them a <unk> little supper , and the Queen , who , as I before told you , was a clever woman , entertained them wonderfully .
&quot; I had a little lamb which I loved excessively ; my father called to me to bring it to him that he might kill it and <unk> it .
I was not accustomed to dispute his will , and therefore took it to him ; but I was so distressed at having to do so that I went and sat down weeping beside my mother , who was so occupied in talking to these good women that she took no notice of me .
<unk> is the matter with little Camion ? &apos;
said one of them , who saw me in tears .
&apos;Alas , Madam ! &apos;
said I to her , &apos; my father is <unk> my <unk> lamb for your <unk> . &apos;
<unk> ? &apos;
said the one who had not yet spoken , &apos; is it on our account that pretty Camion is thus distressed ? &apos;
Then rising and striking the ground with her stick , a table rose out of it magnificently covered , and the two old women became two beautiful ladies , in dresses so dazzling with precious stones , that I was struck motionless , so much so , indeed , that I paid no attention when my little lamb bounded into the room , and made a thousand <unk> , which much amused the company .
I ran at length to him , after having kissed the hands of the beautiful ladies ; but I was quite <unk> to find his wool all of silver <unk> , and covered with knots of rose-coloured ribbon .
&quot; My father and mother paid every attention to the Fairies , for such I need not tell you they were both .
They raised the King and Queen , who had fallen at their feet .
<unk> and Queen , &apos; said she who was the most majestic , &apos; we have known you for a long time past , and your misfortunes have excited our pity .
Do not imagine that greatness <unk> any one from the ills attached to humanity .
You must know by experience that the more elevated the rank the more keenly are they felt .
Your patience and virtue have raised you above your misfortunes : it is time to give you your reward .
I am the Fairy Lumineuse , and I come to ask what would be most agreeable to your <unk> .
Speak , and do not fear to put our power to the proof ; consult together , your wishes shall be accomplished ; but say nothing respecting <unk> destiny is apart from yours .
The Fairy Marmotte , envious of the brilliant fate which has been promised her , has <unk> it for a time : but Camion will better know the value of her happiness when she shall have experienced the ills of life ; we will protect her by <unk> them : that is all we are permitted to tell you .
Speak ; with that exception we can do anything for you . &apos;
&quot; The Fairies , after this <unk> , were silent .
The Queen turned to the King that he might reply , for she wept to find I was doomed to be unhappy ; but my father was no better able than herself to speak : he uttered <unk> exclamations , and I , seeing them in tears , left my lamb to come and weep with them .
The Fairies waited with much impatience , and in perfect silence , till our tears were ended .
At length my mother <unk> the King gently to let him know they were expecting his reply .
He took his <unk> from his eyes and said , that as it was decided that I should be miserable , nothing they could offer him could be agreeable to him , and that he refused the happiness which they promised him , as he should always find it <unk> by the idea of what I had to dread .
The Queen added , seeing that the poor man could say no more , that she begged the Fairies to take their lives on the day when my sad destiny was to be fulfilled , for that her only wish was not to be compelled to witness my misery .
The good Fairies , affected by the extreme grief which reigned in the royal family , spoke together in a whisper .
At length Lumineuse , who had already addressed us , said to the Queen , &apos; Be consoled , Madam ; the misfortunes which threaten Camion are not so great but that they may terminate happily ; for from the moment that the husband destined for her shall have obeyed the commands of fate , she will be happy with him , and the <unk> of our sister can have no further power over either .
The Prince we have selected is one worthy of her ; and all we can tell you is , that you must absolutely lower your daughter every morning into the well , and that she must bathe in it for <unk> .
If you strictly observe this rule , perhaps she may escape the evil with which she is threatened .
At twelve years old the critical period of her fate will commence ; if she reach the age of thirteen in safety , there will be nothing more to fear .
That is all which <unk> her .
Now wish for yourselves , and we can gratify your desires . &apos;
&quot; The King and Queen looked at each other , and after a short silence , the King asked to become a statue until after I should have completed my <unk> year ; and the Queen limited her request to the modest one that the <unk> of the well in which I was to be <unk> should be always according to the season .
The fairies , charmed at this excess of <unk> tenderness , added that the water should be <unk> water , and that the King , whenever the Queen should throw this water over him , should resume his natural form , and again become a statue when he pleased .
At length they took leave of us , after having <unk> the King and Queen for their <unk> , and promised to assist them whenever they should require it , by burning a <unk> of the silver <unk> with which my lamb was covered .
&quot; They vanished , and I felt real anguish for the first time in my life , at seeing my father become a great statue of black marble .
The Queen burst into tears , and I also ; but at length , as everything has an end , I ceased to cry , and occupied myself in consoling my mother , for I felt a sudden increase both of sense and <unk> .
&quot; The Queen passed her life at the feet of the statue , and I , after having bathed as they had ordered me , went to milk my <unk> .
Upon that food we lived , for the Queen would not take anything else , and it was only from love to me that she could be prevailed on to preserve an existence , which to her was so full of bitterness .
&apos;Alas !
my daughter , &apos; said she , sometimes , &apos; of what use to us have been our grandeur and our high birth ?
( for she no longer concealed from me my rank . )
<unk> it not have been better to have been born in a lower <unk> , since a crown <unk> down on us such great misfortunes ?
<unk> , and my affection for you , my dear Camion , alone enable me to support them ; but there are moments when my soul seems impatient to leave me , and I confess I feel pleasure in imagining that I shall soon die .
It is not for me you should weep , &apos; added she , &apos; but for your father , whose grief , still greater than mine , has carried him so far as to make him desire a worse fate than ceasing to live .
Never forget , my dear , the gratitude you owe him . &apos;
&apos;Alas !
Madam , &apos; said I , &apos; I am not capable of ever forgetting it , and still less can I forget that you have wished to live in order to assist me . &apos;
&quot; I was bathed <unk> every day , and my mother was sadly distressed to see the King always an <unk> statue .
She dared not , however , recall him to life , fearing to inflict on him the pain of witnessing the misfortune with which I was threatened .
The Fairies not having specified what it was , we were in mortal fear .
The Queen especially fancied no end of frightful things , because her imagination had an <unk> field to range over .
As for me , I did not trouble myself much about it , so true is it that youth is the only time when we enjoy the present .
&quot; My mother told me repeatedly that she felt a great desire to bring my father to life again , and I had the same inclination .
At length , after six months , finding that the Fairies &apos; bath had greatly embellished both my person and mind , she resolved to gratify this longing , if but to give the King the pleasure of seeing my <unk> .
She therefore desired me to bring her some water from the well .
<unk> , after my bath , I drew up a vase of this marvellous water , and the statue was no sooner <unk> with it , than my father became a man again .
The Queen threw herself at his feet , to ask pardon for having troubled his repose .
He raised her , and embracing her tenderly , <unk> her readily , and she presented me to him .
&quot; I am ashamed to tell you that he was both delighted and surprised .
For how can you believe me , beautiful Princess ? &quot;
said the voice , <unk> , &quot; me , the most hideous of crayfish ? &quot;
&quot; Alas !
I can well believe you , &quot; replied the one to whom she spoke ; &quot; I also might boast of being handsome , but is it possible to appear so in these frightful shells ?
<unk> continue , however , for I am eager to hear the rest of your history . &quot;
&quot; Well , then , &quot; said the other voice , &quot; the King was enchanted with me , loaded me with caresses , and asked the Queen if she had any news to tell him .
&apos;Alas ! &apos;
said she , &apos; who in this desert should come to tell me any ?
Besides , being occupied solely in <unk> your transformation , I have taken little interest in the world , which is nothing to me without you . &apos;
<unk> , &apos; said the King , &apos; I will tell you some news , then ; for do not think that I have been always asleep .
The Fairies who protect us have disclosed to me the punishment of my subjects .
They have made an immense <unk> of my kingdom , and all the inhabitants are men-fish .
A nephew of the Fairy Marmotte , whom they have set up as their king , <unk> them with <unk> cruelty : he <unk> them for the least fault ; and at the end of a certain time a prince will arrive who will <unk> him , and reign in his <unk> .
It is in this kingdom that Camion will be made perfectly happy .
This is all that I know ; and it was not a bad way of passing my time &apos; said he , laughing , &apos; to have discovered these things .
The Fairies came every night to inform me of what was doing , and I should perhaps have known much more if you had let me remain a statue a little longer ; but , however , I am so delighted to see you once more , that I do not think I shall very soon wish to become a statue again . &apos;
&quot; We passed some time in the happiest manner possible .
The King and Queen , notwithstanding , were rather anxious when they thought of my approaching the age of thirteen .
As the Queen bathed me with great care , she hoped that the prediction would not be fulfilled .
But who can boast of escaping their destiny ?
One morning that the Queen had risen early , and was gathering some flowers to <unk> our cottage , because the King was fond of them , she saw come out from beneath a <unk> an ugly animal , something like a <unk> .
This beast threw itself on her , and <unk> her nose .
She fainted with the pain which this bite occasioned her , and my father , at the end of an hour , not seeing her return , went to seek her .
Judge of his consternation at finding her nearly dead , and covered with blood !
He uttered fearful cries .
I ran to his assistance , and we together carried the Queen into the house , and placed her in bed , where she was two hours without coming to herself .
At length she began to give some signs of life , and we had the pleasure of seeing her very shortly recovered , except from the pain of the bite , which caused her much suffering .
&quot; She asked directly if I had been to bathe : but we had quite forgotten it in our anxiety about her .
She was much alarmed at hearing this ; however , seeing that as yet no accident had happened to me , she became re-assured , and related to us her adventure , which surprised us immensely .
&quot; The day passed over without any other trouble ; the King had taken his <unk> and sought in every direction for the horrid beast without finding it .
The next day at sunrise the Queen awoke and came to fetch me , to repair the fault of the preceding morning ; she <unk> me into the well as usual , but alas , fatal and unlucky day !
at this same instant , although the heavens were quite <unk> , a dreadful clap of thunder rent the air , the sky seemed suddenly all on fire , and from a burning cloud there issued a flaming dart which flew into the well .
My mother in her fright let go the cord which held me , and I sank to the bottom , without <unk> myself , it is true , but horrified at discovering that I was <unk> transformed into an enormous fish which they call a whale .
I rose to the surface again , and called the Queen with all my power .
She did not reply .
I was sadly afflicted and wept bitterly , as much for her loss as at my metamorphosis , when I felt that an invisible power forced me to descend to the bottom of the well .
Having reached it , I entered a grotto of crystal , where I found a species of Nymph , ugly enough , for she was like an immensely fat <unk> .
However , she smiled at my approach , and said to <unk> &apos; Camion , I am the Nymph of the <unk> Well ; I have orders to receive thee , and to make thee <unk> the penance to which thou art <unk> for having failed to bathe ; follow me , and do not <unk> . &apos;
&quot; What , alas , could I do ?
I was so distressed and so faint at finding myself on dry ground , that I had not the strength to speak .
She dragged me , not without pain , into a saloon of green marble which was near the grotto ; she there put me into an immense golden tub filled with water , and I then began to recover my senses .
The good Nymph appeared delighted at this .
<unk> am called Citronette , &apos; said she to me ; &apos; I am appointed to wait on thee ; thou canst order me to do anything thou <unk> know perfectly well both the past and the present ; as for the future , it is not my province to penetrate it .
<unk> me , and at least I can render the time of thy penance less <unk> to thee . &apos;
&quot; I embraced the good Citronette at these words , and related to her the events of my life .
I then inquired of her what had become of the King and Queen .
She was about to reply , when a hideous <unk> , as large as a human being , entered the saloon , and <unk> me with horror .
She walked upon her hind <unk> , and <unk> upon a gold wand , which gave her a <unk> air .
She approached the tub , in which I would willingly have <unk> myself , I was so frightened , and raising her wand , with which she touched <unk> &apos; Camion , &apos; said she , &apos; thou art in my power , and nothing can release thee but thy obedience and that of the husband whom my sisters have destined for thee .
<unk> to me , and cast off this fear , which does not <unk> a person of your rank .
Since thine infancy I wished to take care of thee , and to marry thee to my nephew , the King of the Whiting .
Lumineuse , and two or three other of my sisters , combined to deprive me of this right ; I was provoked , and not being able to revenge myself on them , I resolved to punish thee for their audacity .
I doomed thee , therefore , to be a whale for at least half the <unk> of thy existence .
My sisters protested so strongly against what they called my injustice , that I diminished my vengeance by <unk> and a half ; but I reserved to myself the right of marrying thee to my nephew in return for my <unk> .
Lumineuse , who is <unk> , and unfortunately my superior , would not listen to this arrangement , because she had destined thee , before me , to a Prince whom she protected .
I was compelled then to consent to her plan , in spite of my resentment ; all that I could obtain was that the first who should deliver you from my <unk> should be thy husband .
Here are their portraits , &apos; continued she , showing me two gold miniature cases , &apos; which will enable thee to recognise them : but if one of them come to deliver thee , he must <unk> himself to thee whilst thou art in the tub , and before thou canst leave it , he must tear off the skin of the whale ; without that , thou wilt always remain a fish .
My nephew would not hesitate a moment to execute that order ; but the favourite of Lumineuse will consider it a horrible task , for he has the air of a very delicate little gentleman .
<unk> , then , thy wits to work to make him skin thee , and after that thou shalt be no longer unhappy , if to be a beautiful whale , very fat and well <unk> , and up to the neck in water , can be called <unk> . &apos;
&quot; To these words I made no reply , but remained very <unk> , as much at my present state as by the thought of <unk> to which I must submit .
&quot; Marmotte disappeared , leaving with me the two miniature cases .
I wept over my misfortunes and my situation , without dreaming of looking at the portraits , when the good and <unk> Citronette said to me , &apos; Come , we must not <unk> over ills which cannot be <unk> .
Let us see if I cannot help to console you ; but first , try not to weep so much , for I have a tender heart , and I cannot see your tears without feeling inclined to <unk> mine with them .
Let us chase them away by looking at these portraits . &apos;
&quot; So saying , she opened the first case , and showing it to me , we both uttered shrieks like Melusine &apos;s &#91; <unk> &#93; at seeing a hideous whiting &apos;s head , painted , it is true , with all the advantages which could be given to it ; but , in spite of that , never in the memory of man had anything been seen so ugly .
<unk> away that object , &apos; cried I to her ; &apos; I cannot bear the sight of it longer .
I would rather be a whale all my life than marry that horrible Whiting ! &apos;
&quot; She did not give me time to finish my <unk> on this monster , but said , &apos; Behold this darling young man !
Oh , as for him , would he but skin you I should be delighted . &apos;
I looked hastily to see if what she said was true ; I was only too soon convinced .
A noble and charming countenance presented itself to my view ; fine eyes full of tenderness embellished a face which was both <unk> and majestic ; an air of <unk> was spread over it , which completed the <unk> of this delightful painting ; a profusion of black hair , <unk> naturally , gave an air to it which Citronette mistook for indifference , but which I <unk> , and I think <unk> , as <unk> a precisely opposite sentiment .
&quot; I contemplated this beautiful face with a pleasure of which I was scarcely <unk> .
Citronette remarked it first .
<unk> a doubt , &apos; cried she , &apos; that is the one we will choose . &apos;
This <unk> roused me from my reverie , and <unk> at my own ecstasy , &apos; Why should I trouble myself , &apos; said I ; &apos; ah , my dear Citronette , this appears to me very like another <unk> of that cruel Marmotte ; she has exhausted her art in endeavouring to make me regret the impossibility of finding a similar object in nature . &apos;
<unk> , &apos; said Citronette , &apos; already such tender reflections on this portrait ?
Ah !
truly , I did not expect that so soon . &apos;
I blushed again at this <unk> , and became quite embarrassed at finding that I had too <unk> betrayed the effect which this beautiful painting had produced on my heart .
Citronette again read my thoughts .
<unk> , no , &apos; said she , embracing me , &apos; do not repent of this avowal , your frankness charms me ; and to console you , I will tell you that Marmotte does not deceive you , and that there is in the world a Prince who is the veritable original of the picture . &apos;
&quot; This assurance filled me with joy at the moment ; but the next instant that feeling departed , when I remembered that this Prince would never see me , as I was in the depths of the earth , and that Marmotte , by her power , would sooner enable her monster of a nephew to penetrate my abode than give the least assistance to a prince whom she hated , because they had destined me to him without her consent .
I no longer concealed what I thought from Citronette ; the attempt , indeed , would have been useless , for she read with surprising facility the utmost secret of my thoughts ; I therefore preferred to take the credit of <unk> ; she deserved my confidence for her attachment to me , and I found it a great consolation , for I have felt from that time that when the heart is filled with one object there is much happiness in being able to speak of it .
In fact , I loved from that moment , and Citronette dissipated , with much address and <unk> , the confusion and trouble which the commencement of a violent passion <unk> in the mind .
She <unk> my grief by allowing me to speak of it ; and when I had exhausted words , she gently changed the conversation , which almost always , however , bore upon my troubles or my affection .
&quot; She had informed me that the King , my father , was transported to the abode of the King of the Whiting ; and that the Queen , at the moment that she lost me , had become a crayfish .
I could not understand this .
<unk> cannot become a crayfish , &apos; said I.
<unk> you better understand how you have become a whale ? &apos;
said she .
&quot; She was right ; but we are often surprised at things which happen to others , although we have in ourselves still greater subject for astonishment .
My small experience was the cause of this .
Citronette laughed frequently at my innocence , and was surprised to find me so eloquent in my affection , for truly I was so on that subject ; and I found that love <unk> much light into the mind .
I could not sleep ; I woke the <unk> Citronette an hundred times in the night to talk to her of my Prince ; she had told me his name , and that he hunted almost every day in the forest beneath which I was <unk> .
She proposed to me to try to attract him to our dwelling , but I would not consent , although I was dying to do so .
I was afraid that he would die for want of air ; we were accustomed to it , that was a different thing ; I feared also that it would be too great a freedom ; besides , I was in despair at appearing to him in the form of a whale , and I <unk> his aversion for me by that which the portrait of the King of the Whiting had inspired me with .
Citronette re-assured me , telling me that spite of the whale &apos;s body my face was charming .
I believed it sometimes , but more often I was uneasy , and after having looked at myself , I could not imagine I was sufficiently handsome to inspire with love one who had made me so well acquainted with it .
My self-love came to the support of my prudence .
Alas !
how rarely it is that our virtues can be <unk> to <unk> <unk> .
&quot; I passed my time in forming projects for obtaining a sight of him , and <unk> him see me , and <unk> by <unk> each that occurred to me .
Citronette was a great assistance to me at this time ; for it must be confessed that she has plenty of sense , and still more gentleness and <unk> .
One day that I was even more sad than <unk> love has the <unk> of <unk> gentle souls with <unk> saw the frightful Marmotte enter , with two persons whom I did not at first recognise .
I took it into my head that it was her wretched nephew whom she brought with her ; I uttered frightful shrieks as they approached me hastily .
<unk> , she could not cry <unk> , &apos; said the horrid Marmotte , &apos; if they were skinning her !
<unk> what terrible harm is done to her ! &apos;
<unk> gracious , sister , &apos; said one of these persons who accompanied her , and whom I then remembered with joy having formerly seen in our village ; &apos; a <unk> to your stories of skinning , and let us tell Camion what we have to tell her . &apos;
<unk> , &apos; said Marmotte ; &apos; but on the conditions which you are aware of . &apos;
&quot; &apos; Camion , &apos; said the good Fairy , without <unk> to Marmotte , &apos; we are too much distressed at your condition not to think of <unk> it , more especially as you have not deserved it .
My sisters and I have resolved to <unk> it as much as <unk> in our power .
This , therefore , is what we have determined on .
You are about to be presented at the Court of the Prince to whom I have destined you from your infancy ; but , my dear child , you will not appear there as you are , and you are commanded to return three nights a week and plunge again in your tub ; for until you are married &apos; -- &apos; and skinned ! &apos;
interrupted the odious Marmotte , laughing <unk> .
The good Fairy merely turned towards her , <unk> her shoulders , and <unk> &apos; Until you are married you will be a whale in this place .
We can tell you no more ; the rest you will be informed of by degrees ; but above all keep your secret ; for if a word escape you which <unk> to discover it , neither I nor my sisters can do anything for you , and you will be delivered up to my sister Marmotte . &apos;
<unk> is what I expect , &apos; said the wicked Fairy ; &apos; and I already see her in my power ; for a secret kept by a girl would be a <unk> . &apos;
<unk> is her own affair , &apos; said Lumineuse ( for it was she who had already spoken ) .
<unk> proceed , my daughter , &apos; said she , &apos; you will become a little doll made of ivory , but capable of thinking and speaking ; we shall preserve all your features , and I give you a week to consider whether what I propose to you will suit you ; we will then return , and you shall tell me if you consent to it , or if you would prefer awaiting here the event which must bring you one of the two husbands selected for you . &apos;
&quot; I had not time to reply ; the Fairies departed after these words , and left me astounded by what I had just seen and heard .
I remained with Citronette , who represented to me that it was a great treat for me to become an ivory doll .
I sighed when I thought that my Prince would never take a fancy to such a <unk> ; but at length the desire to see him and become acquainted with him <unk> the anxiety to please him , and I resolved to accept the proposal which was made to me , and the more readily as Zirphil ( for they had mentioned his name ) might possibly be <unk> by the King of the Whiting , and this idea made me nearly die of grief .
&quot; Citronette told me that Prince Zirphil hunted daily in the forest which was above us ; and I made her take every day the form of a <unk> , a <unk> , or a wild boar , in order that she might bring me some news , which never failed to be in some way connected with the subject which occupied my heart .
She described him to me as an hundred times handsomer than his picture , and my imagination embellished him to such a degree that I resolved to see him or to die .
But one more day had to <unk> before the expected arrival of the Fairies , and Citronette , in the form of a wild boar , was <unk> the forest to find food for my curiosity , when suddenly I saw her return , followed by the too amiable Zirphil .
I cannot describe to you my joy and astonishment ; there are no terms which can express them to you .
But what enchanted me most was , that this charming Prince appeared equally delighted with me ; perhaps I desired this too much not to help to deceive myself .
However , I thought I saw in his eyes that he felt the impression he had made .
Citronette , more anxious for my happiness than <unk> of our ecstasy , <unk> us from it , by begging him either to skin or to marry me .
Then coming to myself , and feeling the danger of my situation , I joined in her entreaties , and by our prayers and tears induced him to <unk> me his faith .
I had hardly accepted it , when he vanished , I know not how , and I found myself in my ordinary form , lying on a good bed ; I was no longer a whale , but I was still in the depths of the earth in the green saloon , and Citronette had lost the power of leaving it and of <unk> herself .
&quot; I expected the Fairies in a state of the greatest <unk> .
My love had redoubled since I had become <unk> acquainted with its object , and I feared that my charming husband might be included in the vengeance of the Fairies for not having waited till they could witness my marriage .
Citronette had enough to do to re-assure me ; I could not overcome my grief and fear .
Marmotte appeared with the dawn of day , but I neither saw Lumineuse nor her companion ; she did not seem more <unk> than usual ; she touched me with her wand without speaking to me , and I became a charming little doll , which she put in her toothpick-case , and then transported herself into the presence of the Queen-mother of my <unk> .
She gave me to her , with orders to marry me to her son , or to expect all the evil which she was capable of <unk> , telling her that I was her <unk> , and was called the Princess Camion .
I took , in fact , a great fancy to my mother-in-law ; I considered her charming , as being the mother of Zirphil , whom I adored , and my caresses were returned by her .
I was transported every night into the green saloon , and there enjoyed the pleasure of meeting my husband , for the same power acted on him , and transported him likewise into this <unk> dwelling .
I knew not why they <unk> me to tell him my secret , as I was married ; but I kept it in spite of his impatience to know it .
You will see , &quot; continued the <unk> , with a sigh , &quot; how impossible it is to avoid one &apos;s fate .
But it <unk> to get light , and I feel I am quite tired with being so long out of the water ; let us return to the reservoir , and to-morrow , at the same hour , if we are not selected for the soup of that <unk> King of the Whiting , we will resume the <unk> of our <unk> , let us go . &quot;
Zirphil heard no more , and himself returned to his apartment , much concerned at not having made known to the Princess his being so near her ; but the fear of increasing her misfortunes by this <unk> , consoled him for not having <unk> it ; the misery of knowing she was likely to perish by his hand made him resolve to continue his diligent search amongst the crayfish .
He retired to bed , but not to sleep , for he did not close his eyes all night .
To have found his Princess in the form of a crayfish , ready to be made into soup for the King of the Whiting , appeared to him a still more frightful torment than the death to which he had believed her destined .
He was sighing and distressing himself cruelly , when he was disturbed by a great noise in the garden ; he at first heard it <unk> , but listening attentively , he distinguished <unk> and <unk> shells .
He rose and went to the window , when he saw the King of the Whiting , accompanied by the dozen sharks who composed his council , advancing towards the pavilion ; he hastened to open the door , and the train having entered , the King first had his tub filled with sea water by the <unk> of the realm who bore it , and after a short repose , and making the council take their places , he addressed the young Prince , &quot; <unk> you may be , &quot; said he , &quot; you have resolved , apparently , to make me die of hunger , for you send me every day a broth which I cannot <unk> ; but , young man , I must tell you , that if you are <unk> with evil powers to poison me , you have taken a very foolish part .
As nephew of the Fairy Marmotte I am beyond all such attempts , and my life is safe . &quot;
The Prince , astonished at being suspected of so base an act , was about to reply with <unk> , but by chance , as he raised his hand , he cast his eyes upon his ring , and saw therein Lumineuse , who placed her finger on her mouth as a sign to him to be silent ; he had not before thought of consulting his ring , he had been so engrossed by his grief .
He accordingly held his tongue : but he betrayed his <unk> in his countenance , which the sharks remarked , for they made signs of <unk> , which appeared to say that they did not believe him capable of such a thing .
&quot; <unk> , <unk> ! &quot;
said the King , &quot; as this <unk> appears so angry , we must make him work before us .
Let them go to my kitchen ; let them bring the mortar for the crayfish ; I shall give my council a treat . &quot;
Immediately a <unk> <unk> went to execute the King &apos;s commands , and during this time the twelve sharks took a large <unk> , which they threw into the reservoir from the window , and drew in three or four thousand crayfish .
During the <unk> that the council was employed in fishing , and the <unk> <unk> in <unk> the King &apos;s mortar , Zirphil reflected , and felt that the most critical moment of his life approached , and that his happiness or misery would depend upon his present conduct .
He <unk> himself with resolution for whatever might come to pass , and placing all his hopes in the Fairy Lumineuse , he implored her to be favourable to him .
At the same moment he looked at his ring , and saw in it the beautiful Fairy , who made a sign to him to pound courageously ; this revived him , and took from him some of the pain he felt at <unk> to this cruelty .
At length the horrid mortar was produced .
Zirphil approached it boldly , and prepared to obey the King .
The council put in the crayfish with great ceremony , and the Prince tried to pound them ; but the same thing happened to them as to the former ones in the <unk> bottom of the mortar opened and the flames devoured them .
The King and the odious sharks amused themselves for a long time with this spectacle , and were never tired of filling the mortar ; at length there was but one left of the four thousand ; it was <unk> large and fine .
The King commanded that it might be <unk> , in order to see if he should like to eat some of them raw .
They gave it to Zirphil to shell ; he trembled all over at having to inflict this new torture , but still more when this poor fish joined her two <unk> , and , with her eyes filled with tears , said , &quot; Alas !
Zirphil , what have I done to you that you should wish to do me so much harm ? &quot;
The Prince , moved by these words , and his heart pierced with grief , looked at her sadly , and at length took it on himself to beg the King to allow her to be pounded .
The King , jealous of his authority , and firm in his resolution , was enraged at this humble request , and threatened to pound Zirphil himself if he did not shell it .
The poor Prince took it again from the hands of the <unk> to whom he had confided it , and with a little knife which they had given him he tremblingly touched the crayfish ; he looked at his ring , and saw Lumineuse laughing and talking to a <unk> person whom she held by the hand .
He could not understand this at all , and the King , who did not give him time to reflect , cried out to him so loudly to finish , that the Prince <unk> the knife with such force under the shell of the crayfish that it cried <unk> ; he turned away his eyes from hers , and could not help shedding tears .
At length he resumed his task , but to his great astonishment he had not finished the <unk> when he found in his hands the wicked Marmotte , who jumped to the ground , uttering shrieks of laughter so loud and disagreeable in <unk> of Zirphil , that it prevented him from <unk> , or he would have fallen on the floor .
The King cried in astonishment , &quot; Why , it is my aunt ! &quot;
&quot; And truly it is she , &quot; said this <unk> animal .
&quot; But , my dear Whiting , I come to tell you a terrible piece of news . &quot;
Whiting grew pale at these words , and the council assumed an air of satisfaction , which increased the ill-humour of the King and his terrible aunt .
&quot; The fact is , my darling , &quot; continued Marmotte , &quot; you must return to your <unk> dominions , for this rash boy whom you see here has chosen to display a constancy that nothing can shake , and has triumphed over all the <unk> I set for him to prevent him from carrying off the Princess I had destined for you . &quot;
At these words the King of the Whiting fell into such a rage , that he could not contain himself : he committed <unk> which proved he was possessed of the most violent passions .
Marmotte tried in vain to calm him ; he broke his bowl into a thousand pieces , and , being on dry ground , he fainted .
Marmotte , mad with rage , turned to Zirphil , who had remained a quiet <unk> of this <unk> scene , and said to him , &quot; Thou hast conquered , Zirphil , by the power of a fairy whom I must obey ; but thou art not yet at the end of thy troubles .
Thou canst not be happy till thou shalt have given into my own hand the case which enclosed the <unk> Camion .
Even Lumineuse <unk> to this , and I have obtained her consent for you to suffer until that time . &quot;
At these words she took the King of the Whiting on her shoulders , and threw him into the reservoir , as well as the sharks , the palace , and all its inhabitants .
Zirphil found himself alone at the foot of a great mountain , in a country which was as <unk> as a desert , without being able to perceive the <unk> of a habitation , or even of the great reservoir .
All had disappeared at the same moment .
The Prince was even more distressed than astonished at so extraordinary an event .
He was accustomed to <unk> was only alive to the grief which the persecution of the Fairy Marmotte occasioned him .
&quot; I cannot doubt , &quot; said he , &quot; that I have pounded my Princess .
Yes , I must have pounded her ; yet I am none the happier for it .
Ah , barbarous Marmotte !
And you , Lumineuse , you leave me without help , after having obeyed you at the expense of all which a heart as <unk> as mine could suffer ! &quot;
His grief , and the little repose which he had taken since the previous night , threw him into such a state of weakness , that he would have sunk altogether if he had not had the courage to wish to live .
&quot; If I could but find something to support me , &quot; said he ; &quot; but in this horrible desert I shall seek in vain a single fruit which can refresh me . &quot;
He had not pronounced the word when his ring opened , and a little table covered with excellent <unk> came out of it .
It became in a moment large enough to <unk> the person for whom it was intended .
He found on it all that could <unk> his eye and his appetite , for the repast was so <unk> arranged , that in fact nothing was wanting , and the wine was delicious .
He returned thanks to Lumineuse , for who else could have assisted him so <unk> ?
He ate , drank , and felt strong again .
When he had finished , the table lost its form , and re-entered the ring .
As it was late , he did not make much progress in ascending the mountain , but stretched himself under a wretched tree , which had hardly enough leaves to protect him from the night air .
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
said he , as he laid himself down , &quot; such is the nature of man .
He <unk> the good that is past , and is only sensible of present evil .
I would now willingly exchange my table for a couch a little less hard than this . &quot;
A moment after he felt that he was in a comfortable bed ; but he could see nothing , for it appeared to him that the darkness was redoubled .
He ascertained that this was caused by the ample curtains which surrounded his bed , and protected him from the cold and <unk> , and having again thanked the good and attentive Lumineuse , he dropped off to sleep .
On waking at daybreak , he found himself in an <unk> , &#91; <unk> &#93; of yellow <unk> and silver , which was placed in the middle of a tent of <unk> of the same colour , embroidered all over with <unk> in bright silver , which formed the name of Zirphil , and all the <unk> were supported by whales formed of rubies .
Everything that could possibly be required was to be found also in this beautiful tent .
If the Prince had been in a more tranquil state of mind he would have admired this elegant habitation generally ; but he only looked at the whales , dressed himself , and went out of the tent , which <unk> itself up , and re-entered the ring from which it had issued .
He began to ascend the mountain , taking no longer any trouble in seeking food or lodging , for he was certain to have both as soon as he wished for them .
His only anxiety was to find Lumineuse ; for his ring was <unk> on that subject , and he found himself in a country so strange to him , and so deserted , that he was necessarily compelled to trust to chance .
After having passed several days in ascending without discovering anything , he arrived at the brink of a well which was cut in the rock .
He seated himself near it to rest , and began to <unk> , as usual , &quot; Lumineuse , can I not find you , then ? &quot;
The last time he pronounced these words , he heard a voice which proceeded from the well say , &quot; Is it Zirphil who speaks to me ? &quot;
His joy at hearing this voice was increased by recognising her to whom it belonged .
He rushed to the brink of the well , and said , &quot; Yes , it is Zirphil .
And are you not Citronette ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; replied Citronette , <unk> from the well , and embracing the Prince .
It is impossible to express the pleasure which this sight gave him .
He overwhelmed the nymph with questions about herself and about the Princess .
At length , after the <unk> of their first meeting had subsided , they spoke more <unk> together .
&quot; I am about to inform you , &quot; said she , &quot; of all that you are ignorant of ; for since the time you pounded us , we have enjoyed a happiness which was only <unk> by your absence , and I awaited your arrival here on the part of the Fairy Lumineuse , to tell you what remains for you to do in order to obtain possession of a Princess who loves you as much as you love her .
But as some time must <unk> before you can arrive at this happiness , I will relate to you the rest of the marvellous history of your amiable bride . &quot;
Zirphil kissed the hand of Citronette a thousand times , and followed her into her grotto , where he thought he should die of mingled pleasure and grief when he recognised the spot in which he had for the first time seen his divine Princess .
At length , after <unk> of a repast which came out of the ring , he begged the good Citronette to have the kindness to resume the <unk> of the Princess from where she had herself left off in the palace garden .
&quot; As it is here , &quot; said Citronette , &quot; that Lumineuse is to meet you , you shall , whilst waiting for her , learn all that you wish to know , for it is useless for you to run after her .
She <unk> you to my care , and a lover is less impatient when one <unk> to him about her whom he loves .
The fairy Marmotte was not ignorant of your marriage ; she had transformed our friend into an ivory doll , believing that you would be disgusted at her .
Lumineuse conducted this affair herself , knowing that nothing could deprive you of the Princess if you married her , or if you destroyed her enchantment by skinning her .
You chose the former <unk> , and you know what followed .
By night she resumed her proper form , and <unk> at having to pass all her days in your royal mother &apos;s pocket , for Marmotte had been permitted by Lumineuse to torment the Princess until you had fulfilled your destiny , which was , to skin her ; so enraged was she at finding that you had married her , and that the King of the Whiting , her nephew , could not become her husband .
&quot; As the Princess was no longer a whale , there was no fish to skin ; but Marmotte , <unk> in <unk> , determined to make you pound her , and had forbidden the Princess to tell you anything about it , under pain of your life , promising her afterwards the greatest felicity .
<unk> will he ever resolve to pound me ? &apos;
said she when expecting you .
<unk> , my dear Citronette , if it were only my life that Marmotte threatened , I would give it cheerfully to shield my husband from the torments they prepared for him ; but they attack his <unk> life which is so dear to me .
Ah , Marmotte !
barbarous Marmotte !
Is it possible that you can take pleasure in making me so miserable when I have never given you any cause for it ? &apos;
She knew the period prescribed for your separation from her , but she dared not tell you of it .
The last time that you saw her , you know that you found her in tears ; you asked her the cause , she pretended it was on account of your attentions to little Camion , and accused you of inconstancy .
You appeased her apparent jealousy ; and the fatal hour at which Marmotte was to fetch her arrived .
You were transported into the palace of the King , your father ; the Princess and I were changed into crayfish , and placed in a little <unk> basket , which the Fairy put under her arm , and ascending a car drawn by two <unk> , we arrived at the palace of the King of the Whiting .
This palace was that of the royal father of the Princess : the city , changed into a lake , formed the reservoir which we have inhabited , and all the men-fish that you have seen were the wicked subjects of that good King .
&quot; I must tell you , my Lord , &quot; said Citronette , interrupting herself , &quot; that that unfortunate Monarch , and the Queen , his wife , being in despair at the moment when the Princess sank to the bottom of the well , the Fairies who had formerly come to their assistance , appeared , to console them for her loss ; but the unhappy pair knowing that it was to their kingdom that Camion would be <unk> , chose to be there rather than at a distance from her , notwithstanding what they had to fear from the cruelty and ferocity of the King of the Whiting , whom his <unk> had caused to be crowned by these men-fish .
The Fairies did not conceal from them the future fate of the Princess ; and the King , her father , begged to be the <unk> of the kitchen and <unk> of the King of the Whiting &apos;s mortar .
The Fairy immediately gave him a tap of her wand , and he became the <unk> man you saw in that situation ; and you need no longer be surprised at his having wept bitterly whenever you brought the crayfish to pound , for as he knew that his daughter must <unk> this torture , he always thought she was amongst the number ; and the miserable Monarch had not a moment &apos;s rest , because his daughter had no means of making herself known to him .
The Queen had requested to be changed into a crayfish , in order to be with the Princess , and her wish was also granted .
&quot; As soon as we arrived at the palace of the King of the Whiting , the Fairy presented us to him , and ordered him to have crayfish soup made for his dinner every day .
We were then thrown into the reservoir .
My first care was to seek the Queen , in order to <unk> a little the grief of the Princess , but either by the decree of fate or stupidity on my part , I found it impossible to discover her .
We passed our days in this mournful search , and our <unk> moments were those in which we recalled the circumstances of our unhappy lives .
You arrived at length , and they presented us to you ; but the Fairy had forbidden us to make ourselves known before you should <unk> us , and we dared not <unk> this rule , so continually were we compelled to submit to <unk> for trifles .
&quot; The Princess told me she thought she should have died of fright at observing you in conversation with the cruel Marmotte ; we saw you <unk> amongst our companions with a mortal impatience , it being obvious that , by the direction you took , you had little chance of arriving at us .
&quot; We knew that we must be pounded ; but we had also learnt that immediately after we should be restored to our former condition , and that the wicked Marmotte would have no further power over us .
On the eve of the day on which you were to commence the <unk> of this torture on us , we were all assembled in a <unk> of the reservoir , weeping over our destiny , when Lumineuse appeared .
<unk> not weep , my children , &apos; said that admirable fairy ; &apos; I come to inform you that you will escape the punishment they threaten you with , provided you go <unk> to the mortar , and do not answer any questions that may be addressed to you .
I can say no more at <unk> am in haste ; but do as I have told you , and you will not repent it .
Let her whose fate appears the most cruel not lose <unk> will soon find relief . &apos;
We all thanked the Fairy , and appeared before you perfectly resolved to keep our secret .
You spoke to some , who only made <unk> <unk> , and when you had chosen ten , we returned to the reservoir , where the assurance of our speedy <unk> inspired us with a natural gaiety which assisted the <unk> of our <unk> .
&quot; The last words Lumineuse had spoken gave to the beautiful Camion a <unk> of heart which rendered her charming in the eyes of her mother and me ; for the Queen had at length recognised her , and we three were inseparable .
At length your choice fell on the Queen and me , and we had not time to say adieu to the Princess .
An unknown power acted on us at the moment , and inspired us with such gaiety that we thought we should die of laughter at the absurd things we said to each other .
You carried us to the kitchen , and we had not touched the bottom of the fatal mortar before Lumineuse herself came to our assistance , and restoring me my natural form , transported me to my <unk> abode .
I had the consolation of seeing the Queen and our companions also resume theirs , but I know not what became of them .
The Fairy embraced me , and told me to await you , and relate to you everything when you should come to seek the Princess .
&quot; I awaited this moment with impatience , as you will well believe , my Lord , &quot; said Citronette to the Prince , who listened most eagerly to her ; &quot; and yesterday I seated myself at the mouth of the well , when Lumineuse appeared .
<unk> children are about to be made happy , my dear Citronette , &apos; said she to me ; &apos; Zirphil has only to recover the toothpick-case of Marmotte to finish his labours , for at length he has skinned the Princess . &apos;
<unk> !
great Queen , &apos; cried I , &apos; are we so happy as to be certain of this ? &apos;
<unk> , &apos; replied she , &apos; it is quite true ; he thought that he only skinned Marmotte , but it was in <unk> the Princess .
Marmotte was concealed in the <unk> of the knife he used for that act , and the instant he had finished his task she caused the Princess to <unk> , and appeared in her place , for the purpose of again <unk> him ! &quot;
&quot; What ! &quot;
cried the Prince , &quot; was it to my charming bride that I did that harm ?
Have I had the barbarity to inflict on her such a cruel torment !
Ah , heavens !
she will never pardon me , and I do not deserve she should ! &quot;
The unhappy Zirphil spoke so <unk> , and distressed himself so greatly , that poor Citronette was sorry she had told him this news .
&quot; How , &quot; said she , at last , seeing that he was quite overcome by his reflections , &quot; how , you did not know it ? &quot;
&quot; No , I did not know that , &quot; said he ; &quot; what determined me to take the shell off that unhappy and too charming crayfish was , that I saw Lumineuse in my ring speaking to a <unk> person who even laughed with her , and who , I flattered myself , was my Princess ; and I thought that she had passed through the mortar like the rest .
Ah , I shall never forgive myself for this mistake ! &quot;
&quot; But , my Lord , &quot; said Citronette , &quot; the charm depended on your skinning or pounding her , and you had done neither one nor the other ; besides , the person to whom Lumineuse spoke was the mother of the Princess ; they awaited the end of your adventure in order to seize on your bride and protect her for you ; it was quite necessary that it should so happen . &quot;
&quot; Nevertheless , &quot; said the Prince , &quot; if I had known it , I would rather have pierced my own heart with that horrid knife ! &quot;
&quot; But consider , &quot; said Citronette , &quot; that in piercing your heart you would have left the Princess for ever in the power of your enemy and frightful rival , and that it is far better to have <unk> her than to have died and left her in misery . &quot;
<unk> this <unk> , so <unk> founded on truth , appeased the grief of the Prince , and he consented to take a little <unk> for his support .
They had just finished , when the roof of the saloon opened , and Lumineuse appeared , seated upon a <unk> drawn by a hundred butterflies ; she descended from it , assisted by the Prince , who bathed the <unk> of her <unk> with a torrent of tears .
The Fairy raised him , and said , &quot; Prince Zirphil , to-day you are about to <unk> the fruit of your heroic labours .
<unk> yourself , and enjoy at length your happiness .
I have vanquished the fury of Marmotte by my prayers , and your courage has <unk> her : come with me to receive your Princess from her hands and mine . &quot;
&quot; Ah , Madam , &quot; cried the Prince , throwing himself at her feet , &quot; am I not dreaming ?
Is it possible that my happiness is real ? &quot;
&quot; Do not doubt it , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; come to your kingdom and console the Queen , your mother , for your absence , and for the death of the King , your father : your subjects wait to crown you . &quot;
The Prince in the midst of his joy felt a <unk> at the tidings of the death of his father ; but the Fairy to <unk> him from his affliction , made him place himself by her side , permitted Citronette to seat herself at their feet , and then the butterflies spread their brilliant wings , and set out for the empire of King Zirphil .
On the road , the Fairy told him to open his ring , and he there found the toothpick-case which he had to return to Marmotte .
The King thanked the generous Fairy a thousand times over , and they arrived at the capital of his dominions , where they were expected with the utmost impatience .
Zirphil &apos;s mother advanced to receive the Fairy as she descended from her car , and all the people becoming aware of the return of Zirphil , uttered acclamations which <unk> him a little from his grief ; he tenderly embraced his mother , and all ascended to a magnificent apartment which the Queen had prepared for the Fairy .
They had hardly entered , when Marmotte arrived in a car lined with Spanish <unk> , and drawn by eight winged rats .
She brought with her the beautiful Camion , with the King and Queen , her father and mother .
Lumineuse and the Queen hastened to embrace Marmotte , Zirphil respectfully kissed her <unk> , which she extended to him , laughing ; and he returned her the <unk> case .
She then permitted him to claim his bride , and presented her to the Queen , who embraced her with a thousand expressions of joy .
This numerous and illustrious <unk> began speaking all together .
<unk> reigned supreme amongst them .
Camion and her charming husband were the only persons who could not speak a word .
They had so much to say .
There was an eloquence in their silence which affected every one present ; the good Citronette wept with joy whilst kissing the hands of the divine Princess .
At length , Lumineuse took them both by the hand , and advancing with them towards the Queen , mother of Zirphil : &quot; Behold , Madam , &quot; said she , &quot; two young lovers who only wait your consent to be happy : complete their felicity ; my sister Marmotte , the King and Queen , here present , and I myself , all request you to do so . &quot;
The Queen replied as she ought to this <unk> speech , and tenderly embracing the happy pair , said , &quot; Yes , my children , live happily together , and permit me , in <unk> my crown to you , to <unk> in that happiness . &quot;
Zirphil and the Princess threw themselves at her feet , from whence she raised them , and again embracing them , they conjured her not to abandon them , but to aid them by her counsels .
Marmotte then touched the beautiful Camion with her wand , and her clothes , which were already sufficiently magnificent , became silver brocade embroidered with <unk> diamonds , and her beautiful locks fell down and <unk> themselves so exquisitely that the Kings and <unk> declared her appearance was perfectly dazzling : the toothpick-case which the Fairy held was changed into a crown formed entirely of brilliants , so beautiful and so well set that the room and the whole palace became illuminated by it .
Marmotte placed it on the head of the Princess .
Zirphil , in his turn , appeared in a suit similar to that of Camion ; and from the ring which she had given him came forth a crown exactly like hers .
They were married on the spot , and proclaimed King and Queen of that fine country .
The Fairies gave the royal <unk> , at which nothing was wanting .
After having spent a week with them , and having overwhelmed them with good things , they departed , and <unk> the King and Queen , father and mother of Camion , into their kingdom , the old inhabitants of which they had punished , and <unk> it by a new race faithful to their master .
As for Citronette , the Fairies permitted her to come and pass some time with her beautiful Queen , and consented to allow Camion , by only wishing for her , to see her whenever she pleased .
The Fairies at length departed , and never were people so happy as King Zirphil and Queen Camion .
They found their greatest felicity in each other : and days seemed to them like moments .
They had children who completed their happiness .
They lived to an extreme old age ; loving with the same intensity , and <unk> which should most please the other .
On their decease their kingdom was divided , and after various <unk> it has become , under the <unk> of one of their <unk> , the <unk> empire of the Great <unk> .

PRINCESS LIONETTE AND PRINCE COQUERICO .
In the <unk> mountains lived an old man and his wife who had retired from the world , weary of the <unk> of fortune .
They had found for themselves a <unk> retreat in a cavern , which extended far beneath one of the mountains , and the dread of seeing each other expire was the only anxiety that troubled them in their solitude .
They had lived at <unk> , and knew all the <unk> that prevailed in them ; and far from regretting the brilliant <unk> they had occupied , they pitied those who , from ambition or want of experience , were desirous of them .
They lived a happy and quiet life .
Their food consisted of fruit and fish , the latter <unk> in a large <unk> , wherein the old man amused himself by taking them ; while a flock of sheep which the old woman had the care of , produced the finest wool in the world to make their clothes with .
The old man called himself Mulidor , and his wife was named Phila .
They incessantly implored the gods to send <unk> to console whichever might be left the last upon earth , or to close their eyes , but their prayers had not yet been granted .
It must not , however , be supposed that the gods <unk> such pure and reasonable desires , but they wished to prove the constancy of these good people , to recompense them afterwards with interest .
&#91; Illustration : Princess Lionette and Prince <unk>
<unk> . &#93;
The old man had just caught some fish , and after <unk> his boat to the bank , he spread his <unk> upon a rock to dry it in the sun , when a lion rushed out from one of the <unk> of the rock , and went to drink in the <unk> .
Mulidor was afraid at first , but afterwards finding that the proud beast was <unk> because he could not reach the water , which was too far off from the <unk> at this spot , he re-entered his boat , and filling a bowl offered it to the lion , who came and <unk> it several times .
After he had <unk> his thirst , he raised his head and looked at his <unk> so <unk> , that the good man ventured to <unk> him .
The lion appeared pleased at his doing so , and ate some bread and cheese which the old man took from a basket he had <unk> on his arm .
As , however , this was not a very safe companion , Mulidor thought he had better return to his cavern , fearing that his wife , uneasy at his absence , might come in search of him , and that the lion , having less respect for her than for him , would devour her .
This idea was beginning to <unk> him , when the lion , after <unk> his hand , returned to his own home , leaving the old man at liberty to do so likewise .
Upon reaching the cavern he found his wife , as he expected , alarmed at his delay ; he related his adventure to her , which made her shudder .
They continued to talk upon the subject , and drew this <unk> , that men might learn lessons of kindness and gratitude from animals .
&quot; Do not , however , place yourself again at the mercy of this fierce beast , &quot; said she , affectionately , &quot; or let me go with you , for I could not live under the fear I shall henceforth be in concerning you .
You have been restored to me this time , but can I flatter myself that the Gods will be always equally gracious to me . &quot;
The old man , touched by her affection , promised to avoid the lion in future .
This conversation kept them up late , and consequently they did not awake till the golden rays of morning shone full upon them .
On opening the door to go out and <unk> her sheep , Phila was greatly surprised to find at it a lion of prodigious size and strength , and a lioness of equal power and beauty , the latter carrying on her back a little girl of five or six years old , who , as soon as she saw the old woman , alighted , ran to her , and embraced her .
The good woman stood motionless with fear and wonder , and the lions , after kissing the little girl , who returned their caresses , ran off , and disappeared in an instant , leaving her in the good wife &apos;s hands .
<unk> from her fright she looked at the child , who never ceased kissing her , took her in her arms , and went into the cavern to show her to her husband .
They both of them admired her beauty and gentleness ; she was quite naked , her fair hair only falling over her shoulders , and upon her right breast she had a singular mark in the shape of a crown .
The good people thanked the Gods for this gift ; they dressed the beautiful little child in a light <unk> robe , with a rose-coloured girdle , and tied up her hair with ribbon of the same colour .
She allowed them to do so quietly , and without saying a word .
They <unk> her , and gave her some ewe &apos;s milk quite fresh .
She smiled at the sight of it , and looking at them , uttered a little cry resembling the roar of a lion .
She soon became accustomed to them , however ; she had no resemblance to a lion but in her voice , and from that circumstance they called her Lionette .
She answered to this name , and her natural intelligence soon enabled her to understand what they said to her , and at length to speak and explain herself .
She had been a year with these good people , who loved her dearly , and were equally loved by her , when Mulidor , to make her familiar with their way of life , in case she should lose them , took her out to fish with him .
He had been there several times alone without meeting the lions , but little Lionette was no sooner at the foot of the rock where the good man dried his fish than she uttered a little roar , which awoke the lion and lioness , who ran out to her immediately , each <unk> with the other in <unk> and caressing her .
She embraced the lioness affectionately , who allowed her freely to do so ; at length she jumped upon her back , and the lions ran off with her in a moment .
The poor old man was in consternation ; he threw himself upon the ground and prayed to die , now that he had lost Lionette .
After lying there a long time , finding his despair could be of no avail , he dragged himself to his cavern , and created fresh misery there in relating to Phila the accident that had happened to Lionette .
&quot; Lionette !
my dear Lionette ! &quot;
cried the good woman , &quot; is it possible we can have lost you ?
Alas !
why did the Gods present you to us , so cruelly to take you from us ?
Of all the <unk> we have lost we but regret you ! &quot;
Their affliction was inconsolable , and poor Mulidor had scarcely spirit enough to bear up against this misfortune .
The night was passed in lamentations and tears .
At break of day they went in search of her , fearing neither the lions nor their fury ; their great love for Lionette made them wish to be devoured also , if she had undergone that frightful fate .
They ran to the rock where the lions had chosen to <unk> themselves , when suddenly they saw little Lionette riding on the lioness towards them .
As soon as the lovely child saw them she jumped down , and ran and threw her arms round their <unk> ; then taking from the back of the lioness a <unk> that she had killed in the chase , &quot; There , &quot; said she , &quot; see what mother lioness gives you ; she took me hunting to get game for you . &quot;
These good people were half <unk> with delight at seeing her again ; they could not help crying , and bathing her pretty face with their tears .
&quot; My dear daughter !
my dear child ! &quot;
they exclaimed , &quot; you are restored to us again . &quot;
Lionette was affected at this sight .
&quot; Do you then , &quot; said she , &quot; forbid me from seeing the lioness , that you can say nothing to her , and that you shed tears in embracing me ? &quot;
&quot; No , no , my dear child , &quot; they both cried at once , &quot; but we feared that you had abandoned us . &quot;
&quot; Mother lioness does not wish it , &quot; said the child , &quot; she wishes me to be your daughter . &quot;
She turned round for her to agree to what she said , but she was no longer there , and Lionette returned cheerfully with them to the cavern .
Mulidor and Phila thought this was a very wonderful adventure ; they had many private conversations about it , and determined they would not refuse the child to the Lioness , when she chose to come for her ; at the same time , Mulidor obtained his wife &apos;s consent to consult Tigreline upon Lionette &apos;s destiny .
She was a very learned Fairy .
&quot; I had already thought of doing so , &quot; replied Phila , &quot; and it had better be done directly . &quot;
It was settled he should start the first thing in the morning .
The good woman prepared a present for the Fairy , to induce her to be more <unk> very precious , the Fairies do not desire <unk> was a piece of <unk> ribbon , and a little basket of <unk> , which Tigreline was passionately fond of .
Mulidor set out on his journey to her dwelling ; she had fixed her habitation in the heart of an immense forest which was filled with <unk> was from that circumstance she took her name .
When any one sought her for a good object , the tigers did them no harm , but if they went thither with any evil design , they tore them to pieces , and none such were ever known to reach the Fairy &apos;s castle .
The old man having nothing to fear upon that subject , did not arm himself with any <unk> of defence , and arrived without difficulty at the castle at the moment the Fairy was getting up .
He found her occupied in <unk> large pearls on a golden <unk> .
She received him very graciously , and taking her <unk> from off her nose , &quot; Approach , wise old man , &quot; said she .
&quot; I know what has brought you here , and I am very glad to see you . &quot;
Mulidor <unk> <unk> , and kissed Tigreline &apos;s robe .
He offered his little present , which she received very kindly , then making him sit down , she told him she would consult Destiny in her large book , that she might answer <unk> the questions he came to ask her .
After reading for some time , she raised her eyes to Heaven , then fixing them upon Mulidor , &quot; <unk> , &quot; said she , &quot; to what I think of Lionette .
She must be warned from loving one who is her <unk> opposite , otherwise great misfortune may happen to her , even to the loss of life .
<unk> she arrive at twenty without this fate <unk> her , I answer for her happiness . &quot;
She then informed the old man that Lionette was a great Princess , exposed to be eaten by lions almost immediately after she was born , through the wickedness of a certain Queen ; but she would not tell him anything more , and <unk> the old man to continue to cultivate in the child all those good feelings which he himself possessed , and left it to him to decide on telling her who she was , <unk> to his prudence for securing her happiness .
She then gave him for Lionette the <unk> of pearls she had just finished .
&quot; If she do not lose it , or give it away , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; it will preserve her from many dangers .
It may , indeed , insure her happiness if she take <unk> care of it . &quot;
The old man thanked the Fairy and returned home , where he arrived before nightfall .
He found his wife and Lionette ; the latter embraced him a thousand times , and he tied the Fairy &apos;s pearls round her neck , earnestly <unk> her to take great care of them .
She was enchanted with this new ornament , and the old man related to Phila , as soon as they were alone , all that the Fairy had told him .
They consulted together upon the course they should take , and resolved they would say nothing to Lionette of her birth , to prevent her feeling useless regrets .
&quot; We can tell her at any time , should it be necessary to do so , &quot; added the prudent wife ; &quot; and we should be sorry for it ( not having it in our power to give her more than the education of a simple shepherdess ) if her disposition , sweet as it is now , should be changed by the knowledge of her rank .
Let us attend to her heart and mind : princesses have not the time to do so .
She will learn from her own experience that they are as subject as other mortals are to the <unk> of Fortune , and perhaps she may be the happier for it . &quot;
Mulidor quite agreed with the truth of this , and they applied themselves more than ever to the education of this amiable child , whose natural <unk> left them nothing to wish for .
She was twelve years old , and continued to go hunting with the Lioness , very often carrying on her shoulder a little <unk> , and <unk> shooting the wild beasts .
One night , returning later than usual , the cavern resounded with the <unk> of the Lioness .
Mulidor and Phila both went out , and found the Lioness at the door , having brought Lionette with her , who was seated on the ground , endeavouring to console the poor animal , that appeared in deep despair .
&quot; The Lion is dead , &quot; cried the young child , &quot; and my mother cannot be <unk> <unk> has killed him . &quot;
The Lioness rolled upon the ground , and shed <unk> of tears .
The old man , his wife , and Lionette did their best to <unk> her grief ; but after passing the whole night in the vain attempt , the Lioness expired herself in the morning .
The sobs and grief of Lionette were excessive , she could not leave the body of the poor beast , she embraced it , and shed tears over it .
At length they dragged her from this sad scene , and while the old man buried the Lioness , the kind Phila attended to Lionette , who was in the deepest affliction .
When Mulidor came in , he was much moved by the child &apos;s grief , and was anxious to comfort her , but finding he only increased her sorrow , he said , &quot; What would you have done , then , my child , if this accident had happened to either of us ?
It is not possible you could have felt it more keenly . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
my father , &quot; cried she , holding her arms out to embrace him , fearing that he was offended at the little attention she paid to his <unk> , &quot; if the Gods have reserved so much misfortune for me , I implore them to let me die instantly , for I shall not be able to support it . &quot;
&quot; The Gods , my child , &quot; replied the old man , &quot; do not always grant such rash petitions .
It is <unk> Providence not to submit <unk> to its decrees .
Do you suppose you are the only one who <unk> from affliction in this life ?
Is this the courage I thought you capable of ? &quot;
Lionette cast down her eyes : the severity of this <unk> had brought a slight colour into her cheeks , which made her more lovely .
Mulidor felt he had said enough ; he went out and left his wife to soften anything he might have said too <unk> ; and Phila , embracing Lionette , said , &quot; <unk> , my child , you would make us believe you could have no greater grief .
No doubt the friendship you show for these poor animals is highly laudable , but you must take comfort , and thank the Gods that they have not inflicted on you greater misfortunes . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
my mother , &quot; cried Lionette , embracing her , &quot; how much obliged I am to you for speaking to me thus ; do not let my father be angry with me any <unk> feel I could not bear it . &quot;
Mulidor re-entered ; Lionette ran to embrace him ; he returned her caresses with a <unk> that consoled the charming child .
They could not sufficiently admire the goodness of her heart , her <unk> , her gentleness , and frankness ; and she also loved them dearly .
Lionette , however , continued to deplore the loss of the Lions : a deep melancholy appeared to have taken possession of her ; she dared not give way to it before Mulidor , but she felt less restraint with Phila .
The worthy couple often conversed together upon this subject ; they became alarmed at Lionette &apos;s condition ; they tried to amuse her ; they went out more frequently , took walks with her , allowed her to go hunting and fishing , gave her birds , flowers , shells ; but she preferred hunting to all other amusements .
The part of the country in which they lived was so wild a desert that persons must either have come there on purpose , or have lost their way , to be seen in it , so there was little danger of Lionette meeting with anybody .
Still , the fact of the Lion having been killed by a <unk> was remembered by Mulidor .
He never could understand how a man could get so far without having found out their retreat , or being more astonished at seeing a young girl mounted on a Lioness , and hunting in company with a Lion .
They did not dare ask Lionette any questions about it , fearing they should renew her grief ; and yet they feared to <unk> her from hunting , feeling , good souls , how cruel it would be to deprive her of her favourite amusement .
They only entreated her , therefore , to take care she did not lose herself .
At the end of some months , Lionette regained her spirits a little .
The old man and his wife were enchanted at this happy change .
They <unk> themselves upon having <unk> it by their indulgence , and trusted that she would in time forget the Lions .
She grew fast , and began to evince character ; she was wonderfully beautiful , even in the most simple of her dresses .
Phila had made her <unk> of the finest tigers &apos; <unk> , and a little cap of the same material ; and thus attired , one might have taken her for Diana herself , she was so graceful and majestic .
Her beautiful black eyes <unk> the brilliancy and vivacity of her complexion , which neither the <unk> sun nor the most <unk> wind had any effect upon , nor could they injure the whiteness of her arms or neck .
She was not at all aware of her beauty ; her strength of mind and her education made her above <unk> herself on her personal advantages .
She spoke well , and her ideas were even superior to her language .
The good people were astonished to see her at so early an age evincing so much talent and judgment .
She was then just approaching her fifteenth <unk> .
For some days past , Phila perceived that she had taken the trouble to put her hair in curls on going to bed , and that on going out she <unk> at herself with a kind of satisfaction in a fountain adjoining the cavern .
She mentioned this to Mulidor , who was as much surprised at it as herself ; they , however , did not choose to speak to her about it , but determined to watch her closely , that they might discover the motive of this <unk> attention to her personal appearance , and they <unk> that for some time past she had appeared <unk> , uneasy , and indifferent to matters which had previously amused her .
Lionette returned to the cavern rather earlier on that day ; she brought with her a brace of partridges that she had killed .
The good woman asked her if she felt too tired to help her with some spinning she wished to finish .
&quot; If you could <unk> with my assistance , &quot; said Lionette , &quot; I should be very much obliged to you ; I feel so inclined to sleep . &quot;
Phila consented , and let her go into a little <unk> of the cavern which made a kind of room for her .
She had decorated it with all the rarest things that she had found .
The hangings were composed of the feathers of singular birds , and an <unk> of flowers in shells , which she kept filled with fresh water , ornamented this pretty chamber .
Mulidor had taught her to paint ; she had finished some charming pictures , and with the wool she had found in the cavern she had embroidered some cushions , which she had arranged as a couch .
Upon this she threw herself , looking more like a goddess than a mortal .
The good woman becoming uneasy at the length of time she slept , went to seek her ; she found her , as I have just described , reclining on the cushions ; her eyes were shut , but a few tears that were struggling to escape through their long <unk> , convinced her that the lovely Lionette was in some distress .
She stood looking at her for some time , she had never seen her look so beautiful ; but at length , alarmed at her condition , she drew nearer , and taking her hands , pressed them affectionately between her own .
This action <unk> Lionette , and turning her eyes towards Phila , &quot; Ah , mother ! &quot;
said she , throwing herself upon her neck , &quot; how ashamed I am to appear thus before you . &quot;
&quot; Why , my dear girl , &quot; said Phila , &quot; why do you conceal your troubles from me ?
Do you not know how interested we both feel for you ?
What is the matter with you , my child ?
Do not hide your distress from me ; perhaps I could <unk> it . &quot;
Lionette was some time before she ventured to answer .
She kept her head bent down in the old woman &apos;s hands ; she kissed them passionately .
At length she regained her courage , and raising herself , her cheeks <unk> with <unk> , &quot; I am about to tell you something , &quot; said she , &quot; which has tormented me for some time past .
Let me hope this avowal at least will serve to obtain your forgiveness . &quot;
&quot; Speak , my dear girl , &quot; said Phila , &quot; and fear nothing .
I am more uneasy at your grief than angry at your having concealed it from me . &quot;
Lionette encouraged by this , told her that , on her way to the forest , about three months ago , she had seen a young shepherd fast asleep , and that an arrow which she had shot at a bird having <unk> it , fell and pierced the young man &apos;s hand ; that attracted by the cry he uttered , she approached him , and assisted in <unk> the blood .
&quot; This wound , &quot; she added , &quot; awoke in my heart a strange emotion .
I trembled in <unk> to it the <unk> I had gathered , the <unk> of which you had taught me .
He , far from being angry with me , told me he should never complain of that wound , but <unk> of the one my eyes had inflicted on him .
&quot; This language , quite new to me , was so <unk> that I wished never to quit him .
He wept as he gazed on me ; he kissed my hands to detain me .
I proposed that he should follow me , that my father might assist in curing him .
<unk> cannot do so , beautiful Lionette , &apos; said he ( I had told him my name ) , &apos; a most cruel fate has forced me to fly from the world ; but promise me to come sometimes and cheer my solitude , and I shall ask nothing more from the Gods .
I shall believe their anger is appeased . &apos;
I did promise <unk> asked me too tenderly to be refused .
At length I felt you would be uneasy at my stay , and I left him with so much regret that I burst into tears , and hurried away that he might not perceive it , for I was ashamed , I think , of my compassion for him .
&quot; I returned , <unk> and miserable .
<unk> morning I went in search of him .
I cannot tell what prevented me from making you acquainted with it , but I was on the point of telling you a hundred times , and as often I felt it would be impossible to do <unk> it was because he had begged me to keep it a secret .
I ran to look for him , to ask his permission to tell you .
<unk> the spot where we had seen each other the evening before , I stopped suddenly .
A feeling of reproach came over me for having hidden this proceeding from you ; and besides , I was so agitated , I feared I should be ill . &apos; What shall I do by myself here ? &apos;
thought I ; &apos; I am without help , and that which I might find is perhaps dangerous to wait for .
<unk> Lionette , what hast thou promised to do ?
<unk> , return to thy duty , for it is clear that thou hast wandered from it , since thou art so much disturbed at taking this secret step .
The Gods warn thee .
This state of mind is not natural . &apos;
I had sat down to reflect .
I got up .
I retraced my steps , when a <unk> thought arrested me .
&apos;Alas ! &apos;
said I , &apos; perhaps he is unable to come to meet me , from the wound I inflicted on him ; and if so , what will be his despair at not seeing me ?
There is no one to help him in this <unk> place but myself .
To refuse him my assistance would be inhuman .
Let me find out whether he <unk> me , and see him but for that . &apos;
&quot; I proceeded , therefore , to the fatal place where I had wounded him the evening before .
He was not there .
I became alarmed ; my <unk> failed me ; I fell upon the moss which covered the ground .
I saw some <unk> of his blood still remaining on it .
I was nearly <unk> by my grief .
<unk> my tears flowed , and that relieved me ; but I felt the keenest affliction when I thought that perhaps I had been the cause of his death .
I drew out my arrows , and broke them <unk> as a punishment for my cruelty .
I caught sight by chance of the one with which I had wounded him .
It was still upon the ground , and <unk> with his blood .
My tears flowed <unk> at this frightful sight .
I gave utterance to my agony in piercing shrieks .
They were interrupted by the sight of the young shepherd himself , running quickly towards me .
I could not rise .
He threw himself on his knees near me , in so much terror that I was alarmed myself at his excessive <unk> .
He asked me what had happened .
At the same time I put the same question to him .
We re-assured each other .
I told him the reason of my tears .
Never was any one thanked so tenderly .
His words had a charm in them that went to my heart .
I listened with a pleasure I had never felt before ; I nearly forgot his wound , so much I feared to <unk> him .
I was astonished , however , to hear him say how much he loved <unk> , whom I had scarcely ever seen ; and I was still more surprised to find how dear he had become to me , for he told me more than I could dare tell him ; and I believe he could read my heart , for I thought exactly as he did , only it appeared to me I could not so well have expressed myself .
&quot; At last he told me that he wished to be mine .
<unk> are you not so already ? &apos;
said I.
<unk> you be more so than you are ?
That would enchant me . &apos;
He smiled at my words .
I thought I had said something wrong , and I blushed at my <unk> manner of expressing myself .
I know not what he thought , but he said a thousand more affectionate things to me .
He informed me he was the son of a great king , and would be my husband .
<unk> cannot be your wife , &apos; said I : &apos; they will not let me . &apos;
<unk> !
who will oppose it , &apos; exclaimed he , &apos; if you consent ? &apos;
I then told him that my father and mother had always said a crown would be an obstacle to the happiness of my life , and that they certainly would never consent to such a union .
<unk> for a few days , &apos; said he , &apos; and I will tell you how to soften their severity .
If you love me you will assist me in <unk> it ; but never refrain from coming to this place .
My life depends upon your <unk> .
Fear nothing from me , lovely Lionette ; nothing can be <unk> than my affection , and I call all the divinities of the forest to witness that I shall ever respect as much as I love you . &apos;
He gave me his hand ; I gave him mine , and I <unk> , as he had done , to love for ever , if you consented to it .
&quot; I examined his hand , and found the wound had <unk> ; I was delighted at this , and left him , promising to return , and not to say anything to you until he desired me .
I returned so absorbed by his image that I felt as though I only lived when he was present .
I had no pleasure in anything but him : the more I saw him the more I wished to see him .
It was the same with him .
He is charming , mother !
and were you to see him you could not do otherwise than love him .
&quot; <unk> months have passed in this sweet union , and now comes my misery .
This morning he told me that it was necessary that he should be absent for some days upon important business which <unk> much to our happiness .
I had never known what it was to lose sight of him for more than a few hours .
I was as wretched as he was .
He told me , however , that he should soon return , and that he was even more anxious than myself to complete our happiness .
I wept bitterly .
At length the hour arrived for us to part , I unfastened my necklace , and tied it round his <unk> &quot; &quot; Oh , heavens !
what have you done , my child ? &quot;
exclaimed Phila .
&quot; We are lost beyond help . &quot;
She threw herself upon the ground , and filled the cavern with her cries , Lionette , alarmed at this sight , arose to assist the good woman .
&quot; What is the matter , then , mother ? &quot;
she cried .
&quot; Why should a necklace of such trifling consequence <unk> you to so much grief ? &quot;
&quot; It is for you I weep , my daughter , &quot; said Phila .
&quot; Your happiness was <unk> with the preservation of that unfortunate necklace . &quot;
She then repeated what the Fairy Tigreline had said to Mulidor , and did not conceal from her that she was a princess , but that she knew nothing more .
Lionette , who possessed naturally an elevated mind , was not astonished at this news .
&quot; <unk> well , mother , &quot; said she ; &quot; the more you convince me of the <unk> of my high birth , the more courageously I ought to bear up against the sad events which are predicted of me , though , to speak the truth , I do not believe in them ; and I see nothing unfortunate here but the absence of the shepherd whom I love , and his unhappy name , which made me fly from him without being able to control myself .
These are the only misfortunes I know of . &quot;
&quot; What say you , my daughter ? &quot;
exclaimed the old woman ; &quot; his name caused you to fly from him ?
<unk> this <unk> do not understand it . &quot;
&quot; Alas !
this is the cause of my despair , &quot; replied Lionette .
&quot; I had scarcely tied the necklace round his arm , when he kissed my hand with such transport that I forgot my grief for the moment .
<unk> , beautiful Lionette , &apos; he said , &apos; it is for life that you have <unk> the happy Prince Coquerico . &apos;
&quot; Hardly had he pronounced his name , which he had never told me ( he preferred that I should always call him my shepherd ) , than I felt so horrified , without knowing <unk> , that I fled as swiftly as possible .
He followed me ; he called me .
I had not the power to return .
An invisible hand seemed to <unk> me forward .
<unk> dear Lionette , &apos; he cried , &apos; where are you going ?
It is your <unk> is Coquerico who calls you . &apos;
I ran still <unk> .
At last I lost sight of him , either that I had taken paths he knew not of , or that he was afraid of displeasing me by following me any longer .
I arrived here in such confusion I had some trouble in hiding it from you .
You know the rest , my <unk> that has happened to me , and I beg you a thousand <unk> for <unk> so little from your good lessons ; and although I owe my birth to apparently powerful princes , I shall always submit to your authority . &quot;
Mulidor came in as Lionette finished speaking ; they made him acquainted with this adventure ; he was in great alarm at what might happen from the loss of the necklace , and did not dare go and consult Tigreline , whom they had so decidedly disobeyed .
There was nothing to be done but to wait and see what would befal the Princess .
They entreated her to forget this young man ; they succeeded by degrees in consoling her for his absence , and notwithstanding her melancholy , she took part occasionally in their <unk> conversation .
Two months passed in this manner .
One night they were suddenly awakened out of a deep sleep by a clap of thunder which made them think the cavern was <unk> to pieces .
They started to their feet , and had not time to recover themselves before a hideous and very richly dressed Fairy touched them with her wand , and they were transformed into two <unk> and a Lion , she then transported them in an instant to the Forest of Tigers , where she vanished and left them .
Who could express the consternation of the wise old man , or his wife &apos;s distress ?
That of the Princess was still greater , she reproached herself as being the cause of these good <unk> &apos; misfortune ; and what distressed her still more was , not being able to speak , she had not the power of <unk> them .
This calamity for the moment made her forget Prince Coquerico ; but when she thought she should never see him more , or that if she did , he would fly in terror from her , or at least not recognise her , she uttered such frightful <unk> that the forest resounded with them , and her poor companions came near her to try to console her .
Their grief was redoubled to find they could neither understand nor speak to her .
They groaned despairingly .
At length it occurred to all three of them to go to the Fairy , but they had no power of <unk> the idea to each other .
The Lion was the first to start , the two <unk> followed him , but the Tigers stopped the way , without , however , doing them any harm .
<unk> their intentions were <unk> , they concluded it was by the Fairy &apos;s orders .
They buried themselves in the <unk> part of the forest , and laid down very sorrowfully upon some beautiful green grass , which served as a bed for them .
They passed some considerable time in this place without seeing the Fairy , she took care , however , to send them food by one of the Tigers <unk> every day .
It is now time to acquaint the reader who Prince Coquerico was : <unk> young Prince was the son of a King who had been very powerful , and who had reigned in the Fortunate Islands .
This King was dead , and having left his son at a tender age , the Queen became <unk> .
The ambition of reigning , the pride of being Sovereign <unk> , had closed her heart against the feelings of nature .
She had her son brought up in a castle upon the <unk> of the sea , in luxury and <unk> <unk> ; and her excuse for this sort of education was a prediction of the Fairies at his birth , to the effect that his life would be <unk> if he took up arms before he was twenty years old .
Everything was <unk> that could give him any desire for <unk> <unk> , and the art of war was depicted in such frightful colours that , however <unk> the Prince might have been born , he shuddered at even the picture of a sword .
The King , his father , who had died in battle , was represented to him as so <unk> a sovereign that he <unk> he would never <unk> him .
They had named this prince , Coquerico , in <unk> from his having amused himself one <unk> to the desire of his <unk> looking at a fight between two game <unk> .
He spent his life in walking ; in hearing <unk> romances read to him , the heroes of which they represented in such a manner that he might not have a desire to become like them ; he learned to play upon several instruments , to paint , and to work at <unk> .
The Queen went to see him very often , and <unk> to him the fate of kings in such distressing colours , that he dreaded the moment when he should ascend the throne .
He was just ten years old , the time appointed for the Queen to resign the throne to him , when , walking on the coast , apart from his <unk> , he was caught up by a <unk> , and disappeared in an instant .
His <unk> , surprised that he was so long a time in returning , went to seek him , but could find him nowhere .
The most diligent search proved in vain , and they were compelled to apprise the Queen of this mysterious circumstance .
She would easily have been consoled for this accident if the people of the Island , tired of her government , and indignant at the education that had been given to their King , had not risen in <unk> .
After having torn her ministers in pieces , they compelled her to fly to a neighbouring Monarch , who granted her an asylum .
This King had been a <unk> for two years , having but one daughter , in giving birth to whom the Queen died .
He married the <unk> Queen ; and the people of the Fortunate Islands <unk> a council to rule the kingdom until they could obtain news of their Prince Coquerico , whom they did not believe to be dead .
They were right , the <unk> had been caused by a Fairy , who , delighted at the sight of so beautiful a Prince , and angry to find him brought up so <unk> , had resolved to <unk> him from a mother who had proved herself unworthy of being blessed with such a son .
To cultivate a fine disposition <unk> by so wicked an education , the Fairy was impelled by another feeling less generous and more natural .
The beauty of this Prince had touched her heart , she imagined that gratitude would make some impression upon that of the young Coquerico .
The few charms she possessed , however , were not likely to do so .
She was old , and had a horn in the middle of her <unk> ; but she was very susceptible , and was always <unk> that she had met with none but ungrateful beings .
&quot; By bringing up this young man , &quot; she thought , &quot; he will become accustomed to my appearance , and perhaps my care and affection for him will inspire him with sentiments that may lead in time to that happy union of souls , that perfect mutual love , which I have heard so much of and never experienced . &quot;
Cornue ( that was her name ) <unk> thus in <unk> the handsome Prince to her dwelling , which was in the <unk> where the old man and his wife had brought up the young Lionette for the last four years .
Cornue had built herself a charming palace upon the summit of one of the mountains , but it was <unk> to all human beings , in consequence of the clouds with which it was continually surrounded .
The charms of life , its amusements , both <unk> and <unk> , were all united there .
This palace was of immense extent , although formed of one single <unk> , so <unk> and so beautiful that through the walls one might see a <unk> of <unk> at the end of the garden , which was worthy of so magnificent a palace , from its <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and fountains .
The tasteful Cornue had not spared anything , even in her dress , for when , placing the Prince in the <unk> of her palace , she made herself visible to him , she had enveloped her horn in a green velvet case , covered with diamonds ; her hair , which was rather grey , was <unk> white , &#91; <unk> &#93; and tied with green _ <unk> _ bows , in the centre of each of which <unk> a large diamond ; and her dress , of <unk> and silver , showed her form so truly , that one could perceive the Graces had <unk> among themselves which should give the <unk> touch to it .
The Prince was surprised at this <unk> .
She kissed his hand , and asked his forgiveness for taking him away from his retirement without his permission .
&quot; If I can avoid being your king , &quot; said he , with an air which showed that he was not alarmed at the manner in which he had been conducted thither , &quot; I should be very well contented , for the fear of ascending the throne made me desirous of leaving my kingdom , and you have done me a favour in taking me away from it ; --but I should like to know , &quot; added he , quickly , &quot; why you wear so pointed a head-dress , and why your dress is of so peculiar a colour ? &quot;
&quot; We excuse such <unk> questions at your age , &quot; said the Fairy , slightly blushing ; &quot; you will be ashamed of them some day ; --but let us enter the palace , and you will find something to occupy your attention more agreeably . &quot;
She then gave him her hand , and they passed into a saloon in keeping with the beauty of the rest of the palace .
A hundred black slaves were arranged in two <unk> , through which the Prince and the Fairy proceeded to the centre .
It was sufficiently light to see the <unk> which ornamented this beautiful place ; statues , <unk> <unk> , porcelain , furniture , were all admired with the taste of a <unk> by the young Prince .
The slave opened the door of a magnificent gallery , filled with <unk> , <unk> of the world , instruments of <unk> , <unk> of the most beautiful <unk> in <unk> , Europe , and <unk> ; of palaces where the men and women of each nation were dressed in their <unk> <unk> , and by the Fairy &apos;s skill they moved hither and thither , spoke in their own language , and held conversations according to their position .
This amused the Prince for a considerable time .
He requested the Fairy to allow him to remain in that gallery a little longer than she seemed inclined to do .
He made the slaves who accompanied him explain what this all meant ; he bade them repeat it , and was quite enchanted .
He recognised the Fortunate Islands ; he saw his <unk> seeking for him , and who appeared in despair at not finding <unk> touched his heart with pity .
The Fairy at length withdrew him from this scene , that he might not witness the <unk> .
She amused him with other objects .
Some <unk> surrounded by the sea , upon another model , afforded him great entertainment .
<unk> filled with <unk> executed some wonderful <unk> ; then there was a <unk> , followed by a <unk> , which dispersed the ships and sank several of them .
This terminated the <unk> of this day .
The Fairy then proposed supper , after which an opera was represented ; this was succeeded by a ball , and the Prince danced with the Fairy , and with the nymphs in the Fairy &apos;s train , and at last six slaves conducted him to a handsome apartment , in which he retired to rest .
The next and following days were passed in conversations , sometimes serious , sometimes <unk> ; the slaves had orders to cultivate his taste for the <unk> while amusing him , to which purpose he <unk> himself readily .
He was already accustomed to walk in a second gallery , which formed a superb <unk> ; he heard them talk of arms and of war with pleasure ; he almost wished to witness a battle , and felt ashamed he had ever thought otherwise .
The slaves formed themselves into <unk> , he placed himself at their head , he enjoyed his triumph in a <unk> fight , he invented <unk> , he sought for glory everywhere ; he no longer feared to be a king .
The gallery of <unk> had displayed to him the pleasures of royalty ; he passed three hours each day in it , and took lessons from the <unk> <unk> .
The cabinet secrets of all the <unk> in the universe were no secrets to him .
There was a model of the whole <unk> in that gallery , and what art <unk> that grand work !
Not only all the kingdoms and their various provinces , to the smallest habitation , were represented ; but every mortal upon the face of the earth was seen in pursuit of his <unk> .
All spoke their own language , you heard them , you saw them , <unk> most secret actions were displayed therein : the ocean and its vessels , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , deserts , even yet <unk> countries , <unk> was hidden from the learned Cornue .
All was to be found in her model .
There was <unk> to amuse one during the <unk> life that ever was known .
The Prince was <unk> by this wonderful work of art ; he <unk> it for a long time ; he could with difficulty tear himself from it ; nor did he consent to do so till the Fairy assured him that this gallery forming a portion of his suite of apartments , he might visit it whenever he wished .
He left it at length to enjoy new <unk> opera , a supper , followed by a magnificent ball , in which the fairies of Cornue &apos;s Court distinguished themselves in dancing , notwithstanding they were ugly and old , for their mistress took care not to <unk> the reproach of being the least handsome person in the Palace ; and the designs she had upon the heart of the young Prince would not admit of her <unk> anything that would bring them to bear .
His education was entrusted to six fairies , who led him each morning into the gallery of the <unk> for three hours ; they explained the various <unk> of Princes , he learned their <unk> , he heard and saw the effect of their <unk> , their <unk> by land and sea , which displayed to him the ability of ministers and of <unk> .
<unk> he was able to form sound <unk> , and to speak of things with the knowledge acquired from experience .
His noble mind developed itself , he burned with a desire for glory , he blushed at having been afraid of it .
He also <unk> the pleasures of royalty , he began to find a satisfaction in being master , but he did not at all <unk> the soft and <unk> life which he perceived in the <unk> of the sovereigns of <unk> and <unk> ; he preferred those kings who reigned absolutely over their subjects , with a certainty that they would shed their blood to preserve theirs .
<unk> he became the most accomplished Prince living .
He was not ignorant upon any point ; his fine intellect <unk> his slight experience , he evinced in everything the greatest judgment and <unk> .
&quot; But where can one see this land , and the inhabitants , that I observe in my model ? &quot;
said he sometimes to Cornue .
&quot; I will show you some day , &quot; answered she ; &quot; it is not time yet . &quot;
That would <unk> him ; he was desirous of appearing of some consequence himself in this fine plan of the universe , he was annoyed at not seeing himself in it .
This caused him many reflections , but as they only <unk> from his brain , they did not distress him <unk> suggested by the heart , more interesting , he knew nothing of yet .
The Fairy did not fear that the beauties whom he saw in the model would awake in him any emotions contrary to her wishes ; they were so exceedingly small , that he could but take them for pretty little <unk> , the largest figure , of a man even , not being <unk> than one &apos;s <unk> .
His great amusement was the opera and comedy ; he went to them very often : the little figures acted wonderfully well , and as he had a great <unk> of <unk> , he attended all <unk> of the <unk> , &#91; <unk> &#93; and <unk> upon them with great <unk> .
Until he was eighteen years old , this gallery continued to be his greatest pleasure ; in fact , he knew no other .
At that age he began to wish to know the people whose portraits he saw ; the Fairy , desirous to please him , dared not oppose him too much ; she put him off with promises , but feared he would escape her .
&quot; I hunt in your park , &quot; he said ; &quot; I walk in it ; I always see the same things , it <unk> me ; I should like sometimes to see something different . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
truly , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; you have well preserved the faults of human kind .
<unk> state of men !
Can they be perfectly happy ? <unk> cannot believe themselves to be so , they sigh for what they do not possess , and when they have obtained it they are disgusted with it .
Ah !
what have you to wish for here ?
do you not reign here ?
are you not the master ?
Do you fear <unk> here , false friends , or bad <unk> ?
We live but to please you ; you are all-powerful in this <unk> command ; we obey you .
What being could be <unk> and happier than you are ? &quot;
The Prince bent his head at the <unk> of all the happiness the Fairy had surrounded him with , and found that he still desired more .
He said nothing , but his uneasiness , his agitation , his weariness , appeared in spite of him in all his actions .
Cornue increased the magnificence of her dress ; the Prince did not notice it ; he scarcely ever looked at her .
She was <unk> ; for the idea , entertained ever since she had carried him off , the hope of being ardently loved by him , had <unk> with time , and the Prince &apos;s increasing beauty had <unk> much to her passion .
He was just at that happy age in which we please without much trouble , and love with that frankness which is so soon <unk> .
Cornue was enraged that he did not think of her .
&quot; You ought to love me , were it only to amuse you , &quot; said she to him , one day , when she was very melancholy .
&quot; Love you , &quot; replied he , looking very <unk> at her ; &quot; do I not love you ? &quot;
Then , without thinking of it , he added immediately , &quot; I feel certain I shall never love . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
why ? &quot;
said the Fairy ; &quot; who prevents you ? &quot;
&quot; Nobody , &quot; he replied ; then rose , and took a <unk> , and went shooting for the rest of the day .
The Fairy , in despair at his indifference , and fearing she should lose him if she still persisted in <unk> him , perceiving also that he was <unk> , and that his colour had <unk> , determined to allow him to change the scene , and for this reason one morning she sent for him .
&quot; The time has arrived , &quot; said she , &quot; that I can give you your liberty to leave the Palace .
You will find the vast universe , of which I am about to open the roads to you , resemble a very <unk> ocean , but since you wish to expose yourself to it , I will not detain you ; all I advise you to do is to confide in me when in trouble ( for you will have much to endure before you become King ) , and to commence your excursions by going to my sister Tigreline , and asking her , from me , for the wonderful necklace which can alone preserve you from the misfortunes attached to your fate .
Take this bottle , pour a drop of the spirit it contains upon the clouds which surround the park ; they will open for you to pass , and this dog will <unk> you on your way back to the palace . &quot;
The Prince , who did not expect so great a favour , displayed such transports of gratitude that the Fairy felt nearly <unk> for her trouble by the caresses she received from him .
He promised to follow her advice upon every point , and set out immediately .
The <unk> of the park <unk> a forest so wild and frightful that Coquerico found the world was not quite so beautiful as he imagined it to be ; notwithstanding , he entered this vast wilderness , accompanied solely by his dog .
<unk> by his faithful companion , he was pursuing a path which led to the Forest of Tigers , when suddenly he saw a lion of extraordinary size coming straight towards him .
At first he was <unk> at such a meeting , never having seen a lion in Cornue &apos;s park ; but recovering himself a little , he shot an arrow with so true an <unk> that it pierced the lion &apos;s heart , and he fell dead at his feet .
He proceeded as fast as possible , but his attention was arrested a moment afterwards by frightful <unk> .
He looked in the direction from whence they came , and he saw in the distance another lion , running at full speed , with a young child on its back ; he was about to <unk> it , but his dog pulled him by the <unk> so hard that he thought the Fairy Cornue had appointed this dog to be his guardian , and so , giving himself up to his <unk> , he arrived at Tigreline &apos;s abode without further accident .
As soon as he had told her the reason of his journey , she replied , &quot; Prince Coquerico , you will inform my sister that I have disposed of the necklace that she <unk> me for ; <unk> it was for you she wanted it .
I hope , however , that it will not fall into your hands so soon , whatever advantage you might desire from it .
But to make up for the loss of this gift , which I am no longer able to bestow , I warn you that if you ever <unk> your name <unk> , or without its being absolutely necessary , you will lose , perhaps for ever , that which is most dear to you .
I advise you , therefore , to conceal your name from every one , or at least not to mention it lightly .
Go , Prince , I can do nothing more for you . &quot;
The Prince thanked the Fairy very much , kissed her hand , retired , and returned to Cornue &apos;s palace , very well satisfied with the little he had seen .
He was received most graciously ; they asked him many questions ; he related all his adventures ; he fancied he should never have finished talking about them , everything had seemed of such singular beauty to him .
He was in high spirits all the evening .
They praised him , they caressed him , but that did not content him .
He was resolved to go out again , and the Fairy , perceiving how <unk> he was , permitted him to do as he wished .
For a whole year he <unk> to the <unk> extent of the beautiful country in the neighbourhood ; sometimes he went on horseback , and often dismounted to sleep under the trees during the heat of the day .
This sort of exercise increased his <unk> and his strength .
He was now in the <unk> of his beauty .
He was very anxious to ask the Fairy to restore him to his subjects ; he was tired of this life of <unk> ; his mind , as fine as his person , made him anxious to revisit his kingdom ; but he dared not as yet request Cornue &apos;s permission , <unk> he should appear ungrateful .
This brought back his former melancholy .
Cornue became alarmed ; she endeavoured to amuse him in every imaginable way .
He scarcely ever went out ; he passed his days almost entirely in the gallery of <unk> , and when he saw a battle he could not be got away from it .
What was still worse , he one day witnessed the <unk> of a young King .
At this sight they thought he would go mad .
The <unk> of joy , the <unk> instruments , the pomp of the ceremony , transported him with anger as well as delight .
&quot; Why , then , &quot; said he , &quot; am I to be <unk> here during my youth , when I could be at the head of these people , making either war or peace , <unk> really my <unk> of birth ?
They would detain me here , a <unk> , render me as <unk> as <unk> at the Court of <unk> .
Can I not find a Ulysses who will come to my rescue ? &quot;
He would have given still greater vent to his vexation had they not come to announce to him that the Fairy was waiting for him to order them to begin an opera she had commanded the performance of .
&quot; What , always some fête ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; Well , &quot; he continued , &quot; I must submit to it . &quot;
The opera they were to perform was _ <unk> _ .
&#91; <unk> &#93; The Fairy , who had been told what an ill-humour the Prince was in , watched him during the performance .
She thought that he seemed amused by it , for he was so attentive to the piece .
The fourth and fifth acts he certainly did think wonderful ; he spoke of it the whole of the evening ; he admired above everything the idea of the shield which restored the hero to glory .
&quot; What , &quot; said the Fairy ; &quot; does not <unk> interest you at all ?
Do you not pity her ?
So much affection deserves a better recompense . &quot;
&quot; By my faith , Madam , &quot; replied the Prince , &quot; your <unk> has what she deserves .
I should like to know if the heart is to be commanded ; I believe it to be perfectly <unk> of the will , as far as I am concerned . &quot;
Cornue felt the cruelty of this answer , but she did not appear to do so , and turned the conversation to another subject .
The Prince retired early , that he might go the next day shooting .
This was the day that his hand was wounded by the beautiful Lionette &apos;s arrow .
Upon returning to the Fairy &apos;s palace the Prince considered whether he should speak of this adventure ; he was astonished at himself for wishing to keep it a secret .
A sweet feeling ( hitherto unknown to him ) stole over his mind , and took such possession of it that he was unable to conceal it .
He asked himself what it could mean , and he could find no reason for it .
The name of Lionette enchanted him .
He repeated it incessantly .
The grace , the beauty of this young girl enchanted him , and he found himself within the palace without being aware how he had arrived there .
It was then he began to recover himself a little .
Under the effect of this <unk> feeling , he said a thousand gallant things to the Fairy .
She was surprised at it , but flattering herself that her charms had produced this alteration , she did not inquire the reason of such extraordinary joy .
His wound made her uneasy , but he took care to tell her that he had hurt himself with one of his own arrows , and the enamoured Cornue , anxious about everything that concerned him , cured it by breathing upon it , without further inquiry .
He was in charming spirits for the rest of the day ; Cornue thought he had lost his senses ; she ordered some music that he thought delightful , although he had heard the same every day without <unk> <unk> much does love embellish the slightest objects .
His passion led him to indulge in delicious <unk> , and to discover in his heart the existence of emotions he had never <unk> of .
He retired early , and hastened to the gallery , seeking for a <unk> of her whom he had seen during the <unk> was successful in his search ; he saw the lovely Lionette seated between the old people in the cavern , and when , on <unk> for the night , they extinguished the light , and she was in darkness , he still remained gazing in the direction of the cavern , and did not leave the gallery until the following morning was sufficiently advanced for him to go and meet the lovely <unk> herself .
In <unk> the forest he lost himself , and that was the cause of his being so long before he rejoined his beautiful Lionette .
Unfortunately for the Fairy , her skill was now useless to <unk> the moment Fairies fall in love , their art cannot protect them ; when they recover their reason they regain their power ; but in the interim they can neither punish their rivals nor discover them , unless chance assist them , as it might common mortals .
<unk> months elapsed without her having an idea of the cause of the change in Prince Coquerico ; she heard no more of his <unk> <unk> ; a country life and retirement was all he now desired ; he dressed himself as a shepherd ; he composed <unk> and <unk> ; he engraved them upon the trees in the park , accompanied by gallant and amorous devices that the Fairy could not understand .
When she asked him for an explanation , he smiled , and told her it was not for him to instruct so learned a person as she was .
&quot; <unk> your own heart , Madam , &quot; added he , &quot; that will teach you ; it was mine that dictated it all to me . &quot;
The Fairy was quite contented with this answer ; she <unk> it according to her own wishes , but she could not <unk> to herself the Prince &apos;s frequent absence , after all he had said to her ; for he went out the first thing in the morning , and did not return till the last thing at night .
She passed whole days in thinking about new dresses and different entertainments .
As she had a lively imagination , she succeeded with the latter , but the former were absolutely <unk> age and her horn entirely defeated all attempts at <unk> .
It was upon this occasion that she invented the _ <unk> _ , which have been ever since so successful .
The Prince often indulged in this agreeable <unk> , and with his heart full of the beautiful Lionette , he spoke to the Fairy as though he were addressing his love , and the credulous Cornue took it all to herself .
<unk> the end of the third month of this intense and secret passion , the Prince at length resolved to ask the Fairy to conduct him to his own kingdom .
It was not ambition that induced him to wish it , but a higher and more delicate sentiment .
Why conceal it ?
Love itself made him anxious to ascend the throne , that he might place the beautiful Lionette on it beside him .
He had scarcely spoken to the Fairy about it before she consented , flattering herself that he wished to share his crown with her .
With what pleasure did she order everything for his departure .
The Prince , as we know , took leave of his lovely shepherdess , and set out , with the Fairy and a numerous suite , for the kingdom of the Fortunate Isles .
Cornue was seated with him in a car of rock crystal , drawn by a dozen <unk> ; their harness was of gold and rubies , as brilliant as the sun .
A dozen other <unk> , as pompous , followed ; and the Prince , as beautiful as Cupid , and magnificently dressed , attracted the attention of every one .
He had most carefully concealed the necklace that the lovely Lionette had given him ; he wore it on his left arm as a bracelet , and his dress covered it .
He was delighted at the thought of appearing before Lionette in such grand apparel , and to read in her looks the joy such proof of his love would give her ; but he could not help feeling a secret anxiety , which at times cast a cloud over his mind ; he attributed it to the distance between him and his love , and sometimes he thought he had done wrong in going so far away from her .
&quot; The happiness I am seeking , is it worth what I lose ? &quot;
said he .
&quot; Lionette loves me as she has seen me ; will she love me more for possessing a crown ?
Ah !
Lionette , I know you too well to wrong you so much ; your noble and simple heart only <unk> that true grandeur which places man above his <unk> by the <unk> of his mind . &quot;
At length he arrived at the Fortunate Isles , and the people , delighted to see their Prince again , received him with acclamations .
He was crowned , and by the attentions of the enamoured Cornue , the ceremony was followed by magnificent fêtes , in which the Prince , from gratitude , insisted on her sharing all the honours .
The fêtes ended , and the affairs of this fine kingdom put in order by the Fairy and the ministers she had chosen , she determined to have a complete explanation with the King , and began by <unk> <unk> that he should marry .
She had gained the ministers over to her wishes , and induced them to join in the proposition she had made to him ; but who can tell Cornue &apos;s astonishment when the young Prince replied by <unk> his love for the beautiful Lionette , and <unk> her to assist in rendering him happy , by <unk> him to share his throne with the object of his affections !
&quot; Ah !
where have you seen this Lionette ? &quot;
replied the Fairy , with a look in which astonishment , rage , and vexation were equally visible .
&quot; What , then , &quot; added she , &quot; is this the return for my care of you ? &quot;
The Prince , astonished at this sharp reply , and not fearing her reproaches , ended by relating his interview with Lionette , and painted his affection in such <unk> colours that she plainly saw the opposition she might make against it would only tend to <unk> him and increase his passion ; then <unk> making her decision , &quot; I would not speak thus to you , &quot; said she , &quot; but to reproach you for your want of confidence , that you did not open your heart to me .
I should have served you better , and Lionette would have been to-day Queen of the Fortunate Isles ; but you have acted like a young man without experience , and I doubt if I can serve you at present as I could otherwise have done . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
Madam , &quot; replied the King , &quot; you can if you will .
Give me your chariot , and let me go and seek my beautiful Lionette . &quot;
&quot; I will do better for you , &quot; said she , with a forced smile ; &quot; I will go with you as soon as it <unk> midnight ; hold yourself in readiness ; we shall be on our way back before the sun is up , and I know no other means of <unk> your impatience . &quot;
The Prince embraced the Fairy &apos;s knees , transported with joy and gratitude , which wounded her much more than his unfortunate confidence ; she took leave of him under a pretext of consulting her books , but really because she could not contain herself , and her fury had risen to a most horrible height .
Who could describe it ?
All that an amorous , jealous , and mistaken woman could feel , she , as a Fairy , felt still more ; nor could the most <unk> language paint but feebly the tortures which <unk> her heart .
She had promised , however , to accompany the Prince ; but that would enable her to execute the vengeance she meditated .
She felt the more assured of her revenge as the Prince had let the necklace fall from his arm , and had left her without being aware of his loss .
She picked it up , and <unk> the stars for so <unk> an accident , no longer delayed taking <unk> for her revenge , which would have been useless without that precious necklace .
She closed the doors of her apartment , that her absence might not be perceived , and desired the King might be told she must consult her books in private , and at midnight she would be visible .
She mounted a flying <unk> , and speedily arrived in the cavern , where everything was in profound repose ; the <unk> <unk> , which was like a clap of thunder , and enough to <unk> the cavern .
She accomplished , as we have already seen , her wicked intentions , and returned to the Fortunate Isles as the clock struck eleven .
She could hardly restrain her delight while waiting for the King ; but soon the idea of his being in love , and without doubt loved in return , renewed her fury ; she was in a transport of rage when he entered her room with an eagerness which assisted not a little to increase it .
She endeavoured to calm herself , or rather to <unk> her rage ; her fury was at such a height that her horn was in a flame , and the enamoured and too credulous Coquerico , thinking it was an attention she was paying him to <unk> him in the darkness of the night , thanked her a thousand times for this precaution .
They mounted a chariot drawn by three <unk> , set off at full speed , and descended in the forest close to the cavern wherein Lionette had been <unk> .
The Prince only knew it from Lionette &apos;s description of it .
Love <unk> with interest the most trifling circumstance connected with its object .
He had often asked her to describe the place she inhabited .
He remembered every little <unk> distinctly .
He could not be deceived ; besides , he knew her bow and arrow that were in the cabinet in which she slept .
His grief was excessive at not finding her ; he called her , he went in and out of the cavern a thousand and a thousand times , he entreated the Fairy to throw a light from her horn upon places that were obscure , and seeing some little pictures she had <unk> &quot; Ah !
this is her work , &quot; cried he ; &quot; I will preserve them all my life . &quot;
The Fairy was so irritated at his transports , that she threw out a flame from her horn , which in a moment destroyed everything that was in the cavern .
The Prince had great difficulty to save himself from this <unk> .
The Fairy protected him , however , and triumphed within herself at the absence of her rival .
She advised the Prince to seek for her elsewhere .
&quot; <unk> , &quot; said she , &quot; her parents have married her ; or perhaps , &quot; she continued , <unk> , &quot; grief at your loss has caused her death . &quot;
&quot; I know not what has happened , &quot; said the Prince , in a tone which marked the agitation of his mind , and distracted at not being able to find his mistress ; &quot; but I would rather believe her to be dead than unfaithful ; and if it be true that she exists no longer , very soon I shall follow her to the grave . &quot;
&quot; Here is a furious determination of a lover ! &quot;
cried the Fairy ; but considering that under the circumstances it would be better not to <unk> the King , she changed her tone .
&quot; What I have said , &quot; pursued she , &quot; is to prove the interest I take in you .
I am sorry you should have conceived an affection for a person of such low <unk> , and I cannot sufficiently thank Fate that , in accordance with my own opinion , has removed this shepherdess , and thus assisted your heart to recover from its error . &quot;
&quot; I know not if Fate has assisted you to drive me mad , &quot; replied the Prince , <unk> ; &quot; but if so , I feel she has been more successful in that attempt than the other .
As to Lionette , I will repair the defect , if it be one , to be born of obscure parents , <unk> that I believe it possible for her to be what she appears .
In any case , however , happy are the princesses who are as <unk> as she is . &quot;
The Prince now , seeing how <unk> he was seeking for her in this place , entered the chariot again with the Fairy , and returned to the Fortunate Isles , where they arrived at sunrise without having spoken a single word , both of them <unk> one by her fury , the other by his grief .
The King , upon his return , shut himself up in his palace , and thought of nothing but by what steps he might recover Lionette .
It occurred to him he ought to go to Tigreline .
This resolution taken , he proceeded to Cornue to tell her his <unk> .
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; said he to her , &quot; why you do not assist me in this affair ; is your power so limited ?
Is Tigreline &apos;s more <unk> than yours ? <unk> I believe , &quot; he added , instantly , &quot; you are so interested in my happiness , that you would exert all the skill you possess to increase it , if it were possible .
I could not even doubt it , without being ungrateful .
I have had sufficient proofs to be quite sure of it , and I feel that I can never forget them . &quot;
Cornue blushed at this question , which she did not expect , and becoming acquainted with the extent of her misfortune by the latter part of the King &apos;s discourse .
&quot; It is in consequence of that very affection I have for you , &quot; said she , &quot; as you ought to know , that I will not serve you in <unk> a passion that would diminish your glory ; and if you are as grateful as you say you are for the care I have taken to make you happy , and for <unk> your life , you will <unk> an <unk> which will be your <unk> .
What an idea will your <unk> the whole <unk> of a king so little master of himself that he <unk> after a poor shepherdess , to give her a crown which he might share with the first princesses in the <unk> matter whom : perhaps even a fairy might not have <unk> to partake of one with you . &quot;
These last words , which escaped her in spite of herself , opened the King &apos;s eyes , and looking at the Fairy with astonishment , he was convinced of the truth of his suspicions when he saw her standing silent , confused , and carefully avoiding his gaze .
It was some time before he could find words to answer , from his excessive astonishment ; but unwilling either to <unk> the Fairy at the moment he so much wanted her assistance , or to encourage a hope that he felt incapable of <unk> .
&quot; The knowledge you have of the human heart , Madam , &quot; said he , at last , &quot; ought to have taught you that a King cannot <unk> with the laws of nature more than other men .
So pure and intense a passion as I have for Lionette is not of a character to be easily extinguished .
Why did you not exert your power to render me insensible ?
I should not then have felt the grief I have to-day , nor the happiness you speak of .
This choice of a great princess or of a fairy who would deign to receive my vows and my <unk> happiness , I say , does not at all affect me .
Is it necessary that to be happy I must sacrifice myself for ever to the <unk> of my people ?
I must choose for myself .
I would willingly make them happy .
I feel a pleasure even in desiring and being able to do <unk> what can it signify to them who I give them for their Queen ?
I value my greatness only because it <unk> me to elevate her whom I love .
This sweet pleasure would induce me to support the weight of a crown ; without it , what would be every other enjoyment ?
And am I compelled , because I am their master , to be deprived of the only pleasure I sigh for ?
No , Madam ; in giving them Lionette I consider that I make them as happy as I make myself .
<unk> they refuse to receive her , they will repent their <unk> ; and <unk> <unk> to oppose me will find that my love has not made me forget I am a king . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , ungrateful one !
<unk> to destroy me ! &quot;
said the Fairy .
&quot; You know too well all the violence of my love for you , and you only pretend not to see it to overwhelm me the more by your severity .
It is <unk> is I <unk> will expose myself to the danger of <unk> thy base inclinations .
<unk> to punish me , and so complete the measure of your crimes !
But how wilt thou do it ?
Thou art in my power , and the necklace which I hold , and which dropped from thine arm yesterday in my room , will revenge me for thy ingratitude . &quot;
In saying this , she arose , and touching the King with her wand as he advanced to recover his mistress &apos;s <unk> , she transformed him into a cock ; then , opening one of the windows , she threw him down into the court of the palace ; after which , <unk> the Council , she informed them that the King had <unk> himself upon urgent business , and she , not being able to remain longer in that kingdom , had determined to <unk> a <unk> .
This affair concluded , she ascended her chariot and disappeared from their sight .
The King was <unk> with his fall , but his wings had supported him , in spite of himself , and when he had a little recovered his senses he jumped upon a balustrade of white and rose-coloured marble , which surrounded a piece of magnificent water in the centre of the court-yard , to see himself in it .
He was astounded at his <unk> but that he was the most beautiful bird in the world ; his body seemed as though it was covered with emeralds , <unk> wings were of a bright rose-colour , and on his head was a <unk> of brilliants , which threw out a most dazzling light , <unk> tail was a plume of green and rose-colour , <unk> feet , of the latter hue , with <unk> <unk> than ebony , and his beak was a single ruby .
We will leave this unhappy King reflecting upon the cruelty of this transformation , and return to Lionette , whom we left still more unhappy .
This beautiful Princess , after having been six months amongst the tigers of the Fairy Tigreline , deploring her sad fate , was at length withdrawn from them by the Fairy herself , who <unk> her situation , came to seek her and carry her to her palace , with both her unfortunate companions .
Then , after caressing them and conducting them to a very comfortable <unk> , she said to the Princess , &quot; My dear Lionette , you have been a sufficiently long time punished for your imprudence in having given away your necklace , without my <unk> further useless remonstrances to the misery you endure in not being able to change your form until you have recovered that <unk> ; therefore , my dear child , I shall not <unk> you any <unk> the contrary , I will mitigate your penalty as much as I can , and I am going to prove it to you by restoring your good guardians to their natural forms , that they may have the pleasure of talking to you , and consoling you . &quot;
Poor Lionette threw herself at the Fairy &apos;s feet , and by the tears she shed , evinced at the same time her joy and her sorrow at not being able to answer her .
Tigreline touched the Lion and Lioness with her wand ; in an instant they resumed their human form , and after embracing the Fairy &apos;s knees , they embraced Lionette a thousand times , who returned their caresses as well as she could .
After this affecting scene , at which even Tigreline herself could not restrain her tears , she thus addressed the old man and his wife : &quot; Good people , the days of your transformation will not be reckoned in the <unk> of your existence , neither will Lionette &apos;s when she has passed through hers .
Live to serve and console her until the time of her severe punishment shall have ended .
I will not have her shut up any longer ; she can run freely about my gardens and in my forest ; as for yourselves , you will remain in my palace , and have charge of her .
Let us wait patiently for time to bring about a more happy termination to this adventure than I can dare to hope for , and at least by our fortitude cause Fate to blush for her injustice . &quot;
The Fairy ceased speaking , and embraced Lionette with all her heart .
Lionette &apos;s was so full that she shed a torrent of tears , and uttered <unk> which increased the affliction both of the Fairy and the good people .
She spent her days in the forest , hunting game , which the Fairy had ordered to be put there for her .
The tigers respected and saluted her whenever she passed .
She <unk> during the heat of the day in the most <unk> and shady places , <unk> on her fate , and feeling less distressed at her own situation than at the absence or the loss of Prince Coquerico .
She sighed affectionately at the remembrance of him , and her greatest grief was her separation from him .
She <unk> with her <unk> on the <unk> of the trees <unk> formed initials , hearts and arrows , and wept over her lover &apos;s and her own misfortune .
At night she returned to her <unk> , and to the Fairy , who showed her great kindness .
The old man and his wife amused her by relating <unk> to her .
One day that she was at the Fairy &apos;s with her guardians , she seized a <unk> of paper and a pen , and wrote a request to the Fairy that she would tell her who she was .
She presented it to Tigreline , who , as she was very clever , contrived to read what the Lioness had written .
( No one but a Fairy could well have <unk> it . )
She sighed , and raised her eyes to Heaven , then looking affectionately at Lionette , she said , &quot; I am going to satisfy you , my dear Lionette .
The <unk> that mortals encounter often serve as lessons to persons of your rank .
May it please the just gods that those which you have endured from the commencement of your life be the only <unk> <unk> for you .
But do not cease to bear them with <unk> and courage .
You are a Princess , my dear child ; they did not deceive you when they told you so ; you are the daughter of the King of the Island of <unk> ; the Queen , your mother , died in giving birth to you , and the King , your father , resolved not to marry again , that he might preserve the crown for you .
You were scarcely four years old when a <unk> Queen , driven from her kingdom , came to implore your father &apos;s assistance to regain the throne that her <unk> subjects had made her descend from , for having persisted in reigning to the prejudice of her only son , whom she detained at a distance from the capital , for fear he should claim the <unk> .
&quot; This <unk> Princess , perceiving that the King , your father , would afford his assistance too slowly for her impatience , turned her thoughts in another direction .
She cared not where she reigned , provided she did reign .
She therefore resolved to marry your father ; but knowing he did not wish for an increase of family that might deprive you of the crown , and that consequently as long as you lived he would never marry , she came to consult me .
She did not attempt to conceal from me her <unk> intentions respecting you ; and I knew if I were mistress of the necklace that she wore , I should be able to save your life .
&#91; <unk> &#93; I listened , therefore , quietly to her , notwithstanding the horror that these <unk> gave me of her .
<unk> , &apos; said I to her , &apos; you will never obtain your object until I have possession of your necklace .
Give it to me , and be sure of the success of your <unk> . &apos;
<unk> Fairy who <unk> at my birth , &apos; said she , &apos; commanded that I should always wear it . &apos;
Those were her only words ; but since it has not prevented my falling from the throne to which my birth had entitled me , I part with it willingly , and place it in your hands , <unk> much more on your assistance than on the pretended charm to make me happy . &apos;
<unk> , &apos; said I , &apos; return to the Island of <unk> , and wait patiently the effect of my power , and above all , do not attempt the life of the young Princess ; I will serve you without <unk> such cruel means . &apos;
&quot; She returned to the Island , and after some time , married your father .
That very day I transported you , with the King and the Queen , into the cavern where the old man found you , and changed them both into Lions .
The King because I feared his weakness , and the Queen to punish her for her wickedness .
I not only took from her the power of doing you any harm , but obliged her to take care of you .
As for the King , I knew I need not inspire him with feelings of humanity ; he retained them , notwithstanding the natural ferocity of the animal into which I had transformed him . &quot;
Poor Lionette at these words interrupted the Fairy by a melancholy roar .
Tigreline smiled , and caressing the Lioness , &quot; Take courage , my dear girl , &quot; said she ; &quot; you <unk> the death of a good father ; your susceptible heart will feel equal joy in learning that I have saved his life ; that he is at present residing in a part of the world to which I transported him after I had cured his wound ; and that he is as anxious to see you again as you can possibly desire . &quot;
Lionette , who was <unk> upon a great stone at the feet of the Fairy , <unk> her hand softly , to show her gratitude , and her eyes <unk> with so much pleasure that the Fairy , delighted at the effect of her <unk> , kissed her most tenderly .
&quot; As for the Lioness , your mother-in-law , &quot; continued Tigreline , &quot; she died , not from grief at losing the Lion , but from rage at finding her projects <unk> by his death , which she really believed ; and the tears you have shed for her were far more than she deserved for the unwilling care she took of you . &quot;
The Fairy had arrived at this point in her story , when in at the window flew a cock of singular beauty , and <unk> upon her shoulder ; they were all very much astonished ; the Fairy , who was spinning , let fall her spindle , but quickly recovering herself , she held out her finger to the bird , which jumped upon it , and <unk> its wings in <unk> of gratitude , <unk> out &quot; Coquerico &quot; two or three times .
At the first note the Lioness took fright , and ran off as fast as possible , &#91; <unk> &#93; her guardians following her .
In the meanwhile , Tigreline examined the bird , and seeing how wonderfully beautiful he was , immediately <unk> the mystery of this adventure .
&quot; Prince , &quot; said she , &quot; I believe I know you , and I am much deceived if you have not just told me your name . &quot;
The Prince ( for it was he ) <unk> his beak to her feet , as making a low bow to the Fairy .
&quot; Oh , Heavens ! &quot;
cried she , &quot; is it possible there should be such a <unk> chain of misfortunes .
The barbarous being who has reduced you to this sad state has only allowed you the power of <unk> a name which is the cause of all kinds of evil to you .
It has even now occasioned your Princess to fly from you , and perhaps it may have been the last time in your life that you could have seen her . &quot;
The <unk> at these words looked at the Fairy with amazement ; he had only perceived in the room a lioness and two old people ; he could not comprehend these words of Tigreline ; she read his thoughts , for he could not express them .
&quot; She was here , I tell you , &quot; replied she , &quot; and I forgive you for not recognising her ; but if my sister , the cruel Cornue , has been able to change you into a cock , has she not the power also of turning the Princess into a lion ? &quot;
The <unk> felt as if he should faint at this cruel news .
&quot; Oh , Fate !
pitiless Fate ! &quot;
continued the Fairy , &quot; how blind are thy decrees !
Why dost thou punish the innocent , and let the guilty live ? &quot;
Her thoughts would have quite absorbed her if her eyes had not fallen upon the poor bird , who had fallen down , and appeared dying .
She took him in her arms , and giving him some wonderful <unk> to smell , he recovered his senses , but sighed bitterly at being compelled to see the light again .
&quot; Do not distress yourself , my dear Prince , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; I will use all my skill to assist you ; but to ensure my success you must second my endeavours .
I cannot render you perfectly happy so long as Cornue is in possession of the necklace , and it is only through you that I can recover it .
<unk> yourself , dear Prince ; my books that I am going to consult to-night will enlighten me as to what we shall do to-morrow . &quot;
The King could not sufficiently express his <unk> pressed his beak on the Fairy &apos;s hand , and <unk> her arm gently with his <unk> short , he displayed as much feeling as he possibly could .
Tigreline , after giving him something to eat and to drink , which he scarcely touched , placed him upon a <unk> in her cabinet , and then <unk> him , retired to her chamber to set about the work she had promised to undertake for him .
While this was passing , poor Lionette , overcome with a fear she could not recover from , fled with all her might , and had already gone far beyond the Forest of Tigers , notwithstanding those animals had used all their endeavours to detain her , for they were all fond of her , and several of them were even in love with her ; but she had forced her way through every obstacle , and having no <unk> but terror , still believing the <unk> was pursuing her , she ran a hundred leagues at once , and never stopped till her strength failed her .
Her poor guardians called to her and sought for her in vain ; they returned very much distressed at daybreak to the Fairy , to tell her of Lionette &apos;s flight .
The Fairy , who knew that if Lionette went beyond the limits of the forest she had no longer any power over her , and that she would be entirely at Cornue &apos;s mercy , left her <unk> to her fate , and thought only of being of service to King Coquerico .
She entered the cabinet wherein he had passed the night , to tell him what he had to do .
He <unk> his wings at her arrival , and flew to the ground to kiss the <unk> of her robe .
The Fairy took him on her hand , placed him on a little table , and drew it up in front of an <unk> , in which she seated herself .
&quot; Great King , &quot; said she , &quot; the destiny that has <unk> you since your birth commands me to tell you that you will not regain your natural form but upon very severe conditions .
You must be sufficiently fortunate to recover from Cornue the necklace given to you by Lionette .
If you fail to do so , you can never become a human being again but by marrying Cornue .
In that case , if Lionette , whom my wicked sister <unk> upon being a witness to this ceremony , can restrain the grief it must cause her , I foresee that you may become happy at last ; but if she have not the courage to support the terrible sight of that marriage , I will not be <unk> for anything . &quot;
Coquerico at these words bent his head and shed tears , at which the Fairy was much affected .
&quot; A tender heart , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; is <unk> , and even desirable in a King .
Your grief , according to this <unk> , is very <unk> , but you must not abandon yourself too much to sorrow .
<unk> to <unk> minds , my lord , complaints and lamentations , and without wishing to be stronger than humanity demands , courageously resist the <unk> of fate , and if you only succeed in <unk> your fortitude , and finding it cannot be <unk> , you ought to be content .
It is the first of all advantages , and yet one we rarely ask of the gods , because we do not know the value of it .
Take this bottle , and endeavour to throw a drop of the <unk> that is in it upon Cornue .
That will make her swoon away , and you will then obtain your object . &quot;
Coquerico , who was in no <unk> to depart , looked at the Fairy to ask her to explain herself still further : she understood what he would say .
She related in a few words Lionette &apos;s history .
He thanked her in the most affectionate manner he could , and he now <unk> that the Fairy , in speaking of her previously , had more than once called her the Princess .
He was enchanted to learn that this lovely girl was of such high birth , but that did not increase his affection for her .
Nothing , indeed , could <unk> it .
It was not so with respect to his <unk> against Cornue .
Every moment it became stronger , particularly when the Fairy , at the end of her narration , told him that the unhappy Princess had taken flight at his crowing , as well as at his name , from the <unk> that lions had naturally to the crowing of a cock , that the <unk> Cornue had increased it in the case of Lionette , that he had so frightened her that she had flown beyond the <unk> of the forest , and that she might have fallen already into Cornue &apos;s power , as , having once quitted the Forest of Tigers , she could not possibly <unk> it till she had resumed her own shape .
King Coquerico was instantly anxious to depart , and indicated it as well as he could to Tigreline , who could understand at half a word .
After embracing him , and <unk> the bottle under his right <unk> , she opened her window , and he flew away , perfectly resolved that rather than <unk> to <unk> the lions , he would be devoured by them .
To what fearful extent can passions increase in the hearts of those who do not try to conquer them ?
The <unk> Cornue , distracted by <unk> , or rather at the same moment , by the most violent love and by the most frightful jealousy , spent her days in the Opal Palace , <unk> the deepest revenge against her rival and her lover .
What more could she desire ?
Were they not sufficiently wretched ?
They could not recognise each other , and flew from one another as soon as they met .
Could anything more cruel be imagined ?
Poor Lionette , overcome by fatigue , fell down from <unk> and fright upon some beautiful green turf , which answered as a bed for the moment .
She had run an hundred leagues without stopping , as we have said before , and with incredible <unk> , for she had quitted the Fairy in the evening , and by sunrise next morning found herself in this strange country .
So true it is that fear <unk> one wings .
She looked around her , and saw nothing but that green <unk> , through which flowed a clear stream , <unk> the grass and the little wild flowers that adorned it .
She slept there <unk> after drinking of the beautiful water , which possessed the property not only to <unk> thirst , but at the same time to <unk> hunger .
She slept for fifteen hours .
When she awoke she felt much <unk> , and continued her journey along the bank , at the end of which she saw a palace , of architecture as simple as it was wonderful .
She entered it by a beautiful <unk> of foliage ; in it she saw cabinets , <unk> , and <unk> , all formed of green hedges , and what charmed her particularly was , that in the middle of each room were large <unk> of flowers of all sorts , that <unk> her with most <unk> bows , and said with one accord , as she approached , &quot; Good morning , beautiful Lionette . &quot;
This wonderfully astonished her ; she stopped at a <unk> plant that had saluted her still more graciously than the rest .
&quot; <unk> flowers , &quot; said she to them , &quot; by what happy chance is it that you have given me the power of speech , that all the skill and friendship of the generous Tigreline could not restore to me ?
Is it you that have done this ?
Tell me , that I may return my thanks to you ? &quot;
&quot; The stream that has <unk> your thirst , beautiful Lionette , &quot; replied one of the tube-roses , &quot; has the merit of it ; we have no power , and it is only when we are watered by it that we have the <unk> of hearing , seeing , and expressing ourselves .
We are flowers from the garden of the Fairy Cornue ; for some time past she has been very sad ; she came to converse with us , but we were unable to comfort her ; perhaps that task was reserved for you ; you must use your endeavours .
She will not return for two days , as she was here yesterday ; her palace is some distance from this ; wait for her , we will do all we possibly can to amuse you till she returns . &quot;
The Tube-rose then ceased speaking , although she was naturally a little <unk> , but she yielded from <unk> to Lionette &apos;s desire to ask some questions .
&quot; I should like to know , <unk> Tube-rose , &quot; said Lionette , &quot; if Cornue , of whom you speak , and to whom you belong , is a beautiful fairy ; and then I should be obliged by your telling me how you knew my name and who I was as soon as you saw me . &quot;
&quot; A Rose-tree , who is the oracle of this place , &quot; replied the Tube-rose , &quot; at the last sacrifice made to it by the Fairy , our mistress , predicted that a great princess , in the form of a lion , would one day come hither , and that here she would terminate all her distress .
The Fairy displayed <unk> joy at this ; she redoubled the <unk> and the <unk> , they being the only victims that are <unk> here .
This is an answer to your two questions at once , for by the Fairy &apos;s delight you can easily conceive her good intentions towards you . &quot;
The innocent Lionette thought there was great truth in the <unk> &apos;s <unk> ; she thanked her heartily , and begged she would inform her where the Rose-tree was , that she might consult it as to what conduct she ought to <unk> .
The Tube-rose directed her , and she soon found the spot ; it was not far from the cabinet of tube-roses .
This apartment had some appearance of a temple , the hedges forming an <unk> above the Rose-tree , which preserved it from the heat of the sun ; a little balustrade of jasmine and <unk> trees surrounded this beautiful plant , which was covered with so many roses that it was quite dazzling .
The Lioness was obliged to shut her eyes once or twice : she tremblingly approached the balustrade , and <unk> herself , respectfully said , &quot; Divinity of this lovely place , deign to receive my homage , and tell me my destiny . &quot;
The Rose-tree at these words appeared to be much agitated , the leaves and flowers trembled , and became pale .
Then a voice interrupted by sobs issued from its branches , and Lionette heard the following words : -- To the severe decree of Fate In blind submission <unk> .
A Princess , most unfortunate , Will here her sorrows end .
The Princess was frightened at the indications of grief the Rose-tree gave way to , and if the first words overwhelmed her , the latter encouraged her a little .
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
said she , &quot; I fear nothing but the <unk> of my existence ; if I should end my miserable life here , I should bless the fate that led me to this spot ; but wise and generous Rose-tree , before ending my days , may I not know if he to whom I would willingly <unk> them still lives ; and if he is happy , wherever he may be ?
This is my only anxiety .
I should die without one regret if I knew that his destiny was decided . &quot;
The <unk> was again strongly agitated , and thus replied : -- For the last time , at thy desire , I raise my <unk> voice : -- Thy lover only will expire <unk> thou oppose his choice .
&quot; Ah !
wise Divinity , &quot; exclaimed the affectionate Lioness , &quot; I will ask you nothing more ; if he live , I am too happy .
May I alone suffer from the severity of the Fairies !
Their persecutions appear as nothing to me if he be exempted from them , and I permitted to see him happy .
Ah !
why should I <unk> his inclinations ?
Alas !
the choice which I should be opposed to , whatever it might be , would never offend me ; what can he owe me ?
and what can I offer him worthy of his <unk> ?
The unfortunate Lionette not having it in her power to make him happy , should not prevent him from becoming so , at least I may be permitted the desire of being the cause of it . &quot;
<unk> this , she retired to the cabinet of the tube-roses , where she passed the night talking of her shepherd , and telling her love for him to her faithful friend , who in return more fully informed her what she knew of the Fairy Cornue and of her <unk> companions .
&quot; As for the <unk> Rose-tree , &quot; said she , &quot; all we know is , it is not of the rose-tree race , it was here when we came , and I believe that the Fairy , to embellish its <unk> , <unk> us hither ; it speaks without being watered , and appears but little amused by our conversation .
It is naturally melancholy , and you have seen for yourself it has a perfect knowledge of the past , the present , and the future .
The Fairy passes whole days , when she comes here , in talking to it ; rarely does she do us that honour , and I think it is in consequence of the <unk> things she <unk> from it that she <unk> no pleasure in talking to us .
A <unk> <unk> , a very great friend of mine , often repeated their conversation to me .
The Rose-tree <unk> from the Fairy what it <unk> Fairy cannot discover it ; all one can make out is , that it was not always a rose-tree . &quot;
She had spoken thus far , when a <unk> , a <unk> , and some other flowers entered , and after paying their compliments to the Lioness , they announced to the Tube-rose that Cornue intended to visit them a day earlier than usual ; that they might expect her the following morning , and that she proposed making a pompous sacrifice to the Rose-tree ; that they were ignorant of the cause of this grand ceremony , but thought it <unk> the approach of some great event .
The flowers wondered among themselves what this great event could be , without coming to any <unk> <unk> .
They then talked about the weather , a conversation in which they shone greatly , and which would have amused Lionette had she been in another <unk> of mind , but she spoke little , and listened less .
At <unk> the flowers retired each to their home ; and Lionette , after taking a very slight repast of <unk> from the <unk> ground , and drinking the water from the wonderful rivulet , went to sleep at the feet of her faithful friend the Tube-rose .
The first rays of the sun having touched her eyelids , she awoke : the flowers were already on the move .
Lionette arose , and repaired to the Rose-tree .
She laid herself down in one of the <unk> of its little temple , and saw all the flowers arrive , and place themselves <unk> to do honour to the Fairy , who did not keep them long waiting .
The whole of the temple <unk> with the beautiful colours of these various flowers ; some formed themselves into <unk> , others into garlands , crowns , <unk> , in short , into a thousand and a thousand kinds of ornaments , so <unk> arranged that the general effect was dazzling .
The sweetness of their perfume was exquisite ; and that which drew Lionette from her reflections was , that after this arrangement , and on notice of the Fairy &apos;s approach , they commenced so melodious a concert that the most melancholy beings would have forgotten their grief , and have yielded to the sweet enchantment in which this music <unk> the soul .
The Tube-rose , above all , was perfection .
It charmed Lionette completely .
She listened with delight to this wonderful melody , and admired the <unk> of the <unk> which they sang ; when suddenly she saw the redoubtable Cornue enter , blazing with jewels , but more <unk> ugly than can be described .
She was seized with a horror at this sight which she could not account for .
She reproached herself for it .
&quot; Is it possible , &quot; said she to herself , &quot; that I can be still affected by the weak prejudice of which my sex is so susceptible ?
<unk> we to decide upon the qualities of the mind by the beauty or ugliness of the countenance ?
What feelings must I inspire if they judge poor Lionette by her form ?
Judge thyself before thou <unk> others , and conceal not from thyself that if ugliness <unk> thee to take an aversion to any one , thou must thyself inspire a terrible horror . &quot;
While Lionette was <unk> herself to vanquish the dreadful feeling that the presence of the Fairy had possessed her with , the latter , to the sound of <unk> music which <unk> through the temple of the Rose-tree , advanced towards the balustrade and saw the Lioness , who , seated in the corner to which she had retired , <unk> in the most humble manner as the Fairy gazed on her .
Cornue &apos;s countenance <unk> with intense joy at this sight .
&quot; Oracle , whose words are always those of truth , &quot; exclaimed she , &quot; you have promised me that I should one day find that which I have sought for so earnestly , and which <unk> you have reserved as a recompense for the many honours I have paid to you .
Come , &quot; said she to the fairies who followed her , &quot; chain this wild beast , and <unk> it to my chariot , after which let us immolate our victims . &quot;
Four fairies threw a chain about Lionette , who allowed herself to be dragged out of the temple notwithstanding the grief shown by the flowers , that looked as they do when Aurora <unk> her gentle <unk> upon them , for they all loved Lionette ; but their tears did not in the least soften the <unk> heart of the jealous Cornue .
The Rose-tree shot from its <unk> a flame which <unk> the offering of <unk> which the fairies had just placed upon a little golden altar they had drawn towards it .
Its roses became <unk> colour .
Cornue was quite alarmed at this change .
&quot; What prodigy is this ? &quot;
cried she .
&quot; Divinity of these <unk> , do you protect my rival , or is it the joy of delivering her into my power that has produced this mysterious change ? &quot;
The Rose-tree shuddered at these words , and with a strong and terrible voice thus answered the Fairy : -- <unk> to my just wrath The first fowl that shall cross thy path .
<unk> to it dare to show None thyself shall ever know !
The Rose-tree after this closed its flowers and leaves , and by this action appeared to bid the Fairy depart .
She left the temple much discontented , and remounted her chariot , to which they had fastened Lionette , with three other lions who were very handsome .
She took the <unk> that united these animals and drove slowly over the velvet <unk> by the side of the rivulet , the gentle <unk> of which favoured her <unk> , until one of the fairies , following in another chariot , exclaimed that she saw a fowl in the water , which appeared to be <unk> .
Cornue stopped her chariot , and ordered them to catch and bring to her the bird that so <unk> came to <unk> her with the <unk> Rose-tree .
The fairies who were the <unk> <unk> threw themselves into the stream , and caught the poor bird , which was already insensible .
They carried it to Cornue , who was not at all surprised at its beauty , for she instantly recognised , to her great <unk> , the unfortunate King Coquerico .
&quot; Oh , Heavens ! &quot;
exclaimed she to herself ; &quot; is it thus , cruel oracle , thou wouldst have me understand thee ? &quot;
She held the King up by his feet , and having made him <unk> the water that he had <unk> , he <unk> his eyes , already <unk> by the approach of death , then quickly touching him with her wand , said to him , &quot; <unk> thy proper form , and save me thereby from the horror of taking thy life , upon which mine depends . &quot;
At these words the King , safe and sound , appeared more brilliant than the sun , his royal mantle on his shoulders , and his crown of brilliants gracefully <unk> his temples .
What became of Lionette at this sight ?
Her lover stood before <unk> lover a king , and more beautiful than the day !
She would have been <unk> with astonishment even had she not resolved <unk> that she would not speak to the Fairy until she had discovered her motive for <unk> her so cruelly .
She remained silent , therefore , but her eyes were so affectionately fixed on the King , that if he had not been pre-occupied by the adventure that had just occurred , he would easily have recognised his unhappy Princess .
&quot; What more do you require of me , Madam ? &quot;
said he to Cornue .
&quot; Is it to make me feel my <unk> more keenly that you have restored me to my form of which you so unjustly deprived me ?
or do you at last repent that you have done me so much mischief ? &quot;
&quot; <unk> ever , and still more ungrateful , &quot; replied the Fairy , presenting her hand for him to assist her to descend from her chariot .
&quot; Come and justify yourself , and do not accuse me . &quot;
So saying , she stepped with him upon the <unk> bank of the rivulet , and leaving her chariot and her companions at some distance , spoke thus to the King , whom she made to sit down beside her : -- &quot; I need scarcely tell you that I have loved you from your infancy ; the care that I have taken of you must convince you of it , if you still remember it , for I do not expect gratitude for such poor benefits .
I will only slightly touch upon what has hitherto passed , for I experienced but cruel ingratitude , which my affection for you disguised under the name of indifference , arising , perhaps , from my lack of beauty .
I believed for some time that by kindness I should overcome this coldness .
<unk> , &apos; I said , &apos; is but a poor <unk> sensible man is only caught at first by it .
<unk> <unk> fairy who <unk> so far as to desire to please a mortal is always sufficiently beautiful . &apos;
I discovered but too late the abuse of my confidence , and saw with horror that I had a rival .
What did I then do to be revenged , but what every woman would have done ?
Far from <unk> myself of my power , I only <unk> my discretion .
I took Lionette away from you , but I did not kill <unk> excess of weakness ! <unk> she was at my <unk> what a proof of my love do you not recognise in that weakness ?
Your <unk> and contemptuous coldness drove me to despair .
I deprived you of your form , and I left you .
What greater cruelty could you show me than I had inflicted on myself ?
No , all your hatred did not torture me as much .
In what misery did I pass my days after that frightful separation !
I accused myself of cruelty , I forgot all your injustice , and when , becoming more calm , I thought of it as it really had been , I reproached myself with having given you cause for it by too much <unk> short , your image always present in my mind , the thought of your anger constantly <unk> on my heart , I could get no rest .
Some of the fairies who attended on me in the Opal Palace advised me to consult the <unk> Rose-tree respecting my destiny .
This Oracle , without any one knowing the reason , has established itself here , or at least has <unk> itself in the <unk> of Eloquence ( the name that is given to that which you behold here , from the rivulet which <unk> it , because it possesses the <unk> of making everything speak that is watered by it ) .
<unk> by my enemies , I came at last to consult this new Oracle .
I found at first some relief to my troubles ; I took great pleasure in <unk> its abode ; by my art I caused all kinds of flowers to <unk> here ; I raised a little temple of <unk> , and <unk> all the flowers from the <unk> of Eloquence , I enabled them to converse with the Rose-tree and entertain it .
The information I gathered respecting my destiny made me grateful to the Oracle , and gave me confidence in its <unk> .
I came often to question it , and I endeavoured to discover by whom it could possibly be inspired .
I ascertained that it was not one of those <unk> who take pleasure in <unk> themselves to mortals , as at <unk> .
It was a man transformed into a rose-tree , and protected by a power unknown to me , and carefully kept a secret .
I offered him all my power as a reward for what he had promised me , but he constantly declined it .
At last , having predicted an event which has occurred to me this very day , and the commencement of my happiness , he commanded me to sacrifice to him the first fowl that I should see .
Judge if all the happiness I could expect from its promises is to be <unk> in the <unk> against your <unk> that is what he demands of me .
Could I feel , could I know , a comfort , deprived of it ?
Let the Oracle be angry with me , overwhelm me if it will with the most dreadful <unk> , I will not avoid them by the sacrifice of your life .
<unk> , if you dare , to treat me <unk> , <unk> will submit to it , provided I can still behold you ; for I have resolved to suffer everything your hatred can inflict upon me , sooner than consent to immolate you to the strange caprice of the Rose-tree . &quot;
Cornue ceased speaking , and the King , having expressed his acknowledgments , replied , -- &quot; What can I do for you , Madam ?
My heart is mine no longer ; I have no wish to deceive you ; not only is such <unk> incompatible with my nature , but you too well know what I think for me to attempt to <unk> on your <unk> , and I owe you too much gratitude for saving my life willingly to deceive you , were it in my power .
But why have you preserved one who never can make you happy ?
Far better would it have been for you to have obeyed your Oracle .
<unk> that you will always oppose my happiness , I should have received my death at your hands with pleasure , since I can never entertain for you a <unk> feeling than gratitude .
You would have relieved me from the shame of appearing <unk> to you , and from being obliged to <unk> out an existence far from the object of my eternal affection . &quot;
The King was silent , and the Fairy greatly agitated ; neither spoke for some time .
&quot; What did this <unk> Oracle promise you ? &quot;
at length inquired the King .
&quot; If you can be rendered happy by ending my life , why <unk> the sacrifice ?
The generosity you have shown in <unk> it , <unk> in my heart a feeling of <unk> .
<unk> me to the temple , it will not be you that will immolate me , at least ; Love will acquit you , for Love will dispose of my life , as it is he who prevents my making you the mistress of it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> no more of sacrifice , &quot; said the Fairy , rising ; &quot; your life is too precious for me not to struggle to preserve it , at the risk of all that may happen .
Come to my palace , and we will see to-morrow what can be done . &quot;
She then moved towards her chariot , which she stepped into with the Prince , and the Lions went at such speed that they arrived almost immediately at the Opal Palace .
Here it was that Lionette abandoned herself to the <unk> grief when she saw the Fairy descend from her chariot with the Prince , desiring that her lions might be put into a grotto where a thousand other wild animals were lodged that she drove in harness .
&quot; Oh , Heavens ! &quot;
she cried , &quot; to what am I reduced ? &quot;
She permitted herself to be led away to the grotto , and retiring into a dark corner , stretched herself upon a little straw , and passed the night <unk> at her fate .
Some days elapsed without any one <unk> her sad repose ; at the end of which time two young fairies came to take four lions , some tigers , and two bears to be hunted for the entertainment of the Fairy and in honour of the King .
As the Princess was ignorant of the purpose for which these animals were selected , she did not speak to the Fairies .
But what a situation for her !
Her lover , whom she could not doubt was in the Palace , and who could not know <unk> severity of the <unk> horror of passing her days in this strange <unk> gave her a disgust to life , which would not yield to the love she possessed for the King , though it had been redoubled by the sight of him .
&quot; Ah , why should I continue to love him ? &quot;
she exclaimed .
&quot; <unk> he no longer loves me .
And to render my punishment the greater , I feel he is more lovely than ever .
Let me die ; and may he never know the extent of the misery he has caused me .
<unk> of his <unk> of <unk> should I regret to die ? &quot;
She could not suppose him to be enamoured of Cornue ; she tried in vain to think why he was at the Opal Palace ; she <unk> the <unk> that induced her to fly from Tigreline at the crowing of the cock .
In <unk> to her mind the few circumstances she was <unk> of , she felt convinced that the cock that flew in at the window was certainly the same which was brought to Cornue , and <unk> upon the <unk> of Eloquence .
&quot; How contrary is my destiny ! &quot;
said she .
&quot; My heart <unk> for an object which certainly <unk> me to fly from it .
Let me hasten to put an end to this torment .
Can the approach of death be a greater punishment ?
Coquerico , ungrateful Coquerico , has forgotten me .
Why should I any longer doubt it ?
Let me go and expire at the foot of the Rose-tree , and for ever fly from a place that only <unk> and <unk> my grief . &quot;
<unk> the fairies had not shut the door of the grotto .
The wretched Princess stole out , and found herself in Cornue &apos;s forest .
She heard a great noise of horns and dogs ; she entered a thick part of the wood which appeared likely to conceal her .
<unk> to let the chase go by , she had <unk> herself under some low branches , when she heard a dear voice she could not be mistaken in .
This voice spoke to one whom she soon knew to be the Fairy Cornue .
&quot; Yes , Madam , I <unk> it .
I have an invincible repugnance to hunt lions ever since the unfortunate Lionette has been changed into one .
I know not what has become of her .
You wish me to remain in ignorance about her ; you object to my taking any means by which I might obtain knowledge of her present position .
You wish to kill me .
Ah , why , then , do you hesitate , when your Oracle demands my death ?
Let me go to consult it , or with my sword will I rid myself of a life which is rendered insupportable by your tyranny . &quot;
&quot; How can you imagine , &quot; replied the Fairy , &quot; that I should allow you to seek this Oracle who demands your death ?
For it is not that he desires a cock as a sacrifice more than any other <unk> is you yourself that the barbarous Oracle would have <unk> ; and do you think I will consent to that ?
I love you , and you hate <unk> is all my offence in your eyes .
And if I were to restore Lionette to you , you would soon forget even the trifling gratitude you might <unk> to entertain for me . &quot;
&quot; I , &quot; exclaimed the King , &quot; forget it ?
Never !
I forget that I was indebted to you for the happiness of my existence ?
Do not imagine it .
<unk> her to her natural shape , and I swear to you I will agree to everything that depends upon myself .
You will command my obedience , and my friendship will be <unk> .
In fact , if I cannot give you my heart , at least there will be so little apparent difference , that you yourself will scarcely perceive it . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; said the Fairy ; &quot; I trust to your <unk> , and I will yield to your impatience .
<unk> we will proceed to the temple of the Rose-tree .
I will expose myself to its anger .
I will try to <unk> it , and then we shall see if your word is <unk> . &quot;
The King and the Fairy passed on , and the Princess , delighted to find her lover as faithful as she had believed him inconstant , turned her <unk> towards the temple of the Rose-tree , and arrived there late at night .
All the flowers were asleep .
She did not disturb any of them ; she went and lay at the feet of the <unk> did not sleep .
The beauty of the night filled her soul , already prepared to receive delightful impressions , with the <unk> joy , <unk> with a <unk> of sorrow .
The amiable Coquerico , faithful and loving , appeared in her idea so worthy of being loved , that she did not regret all she had suffered for him .
She never thought about his being a King ; she <unk> every advantage that was the mere consequence of chance .
He was worthy of her <unk> was all she considered .
Cornue &apos;s reproaches had revealed her jealousy .
Lionette in an instant therefore understood why the Fairy had so ill-treated her ; and as the happiest love is subject to <unk> , she distressed herself at what the King would have to suffer if he <unk> the Fairy &apos;s passion .
She immediately determined to abandon her lover to her rival in order to save his life , which the Oracle had told her he would lose if she opposed his choice .
Some mournful reflections upon this situation succeeded to those that had so pleasantly occupied her .
She determined to seek the Oracle without delay .
She arose very quietly , and entered the temple as the day broke .
King Coquerico was not in a better situation .
The horror with which Cornue had inspired him by her new barbarity in wishing his mistress to perish by his hand under the pretence of <unk> him the entertainment of a lion hunt , was <unk> : his patience was exhausted , and he only feigned to agree to her wishes in order to gain time to be revenged , by getting the necklace out of her possession .
The Fairy had <unk> not noticed the little bottle under his <unk> the day she restored him to his form ; he therefore still possessed it , and trusted it would be of great use to him .
He retired early that night , under pretence of being fatigued , and the Fairy begged he would wear the ornaments that she had ordered to be put into his room , that he might make a <unk> figure in the eyes of the Rose-tree .
He was no sooner in his own apartment than the recollection of what Cornue had said , and of what he had promised , threw him into deep distress , as he foresaw that if he could not anticipate the <unk> Fairy &apos;s intention , he should only obtain from this jealous enemy the pleasure of once more seeing Lionette , in return for which Cornue would undoubtedly <unk> upon his marrying her .
This cruel thought made him more eager for revenge , and that feeling was increased by his observing a large basket made of pearls and <unk> in <unk> work , which stood on a table beside him .
He made no doubt it contained the presents she had requested him to wear .
He raised the white <unk> embroidered in gold which covered this elegant basket , and perceived with astonishment , mingled with rage , the royal robes that are worn at the marriage of the Kings of the Fortunate Islands .
As they were the work of the Fairies , it is impossible to describe their magnificence .
A moment afterwards , recollecting that he should appear thus attired before the Princess , he could not <unk> himself of the idea that occurred to him , that perhaps such magnificence might make an impression on her .
However , believing the Fairy to be asleep , he resolved to put his plan in execution without delay , and throwing all the ornaments back into the basket , he ascended a private staircase which led to Cornue &apos;s bed-chamber .
He arrived without any obstacle at her <unk> ; the curtains were open , and held back by Cupids of mother-of-pearl ; these also supported crystal <unk> filled with wax <unk> , to <unk> the room .
When she could not sleep the Cupids sang , or read to her the news of the day , <unk> , or fresh stories that were written about the Fairies .
On that night they must certainly have been reading to her as long a story as this , for she <unk> terribly .
She could not have foreseen the King &apos;s <unk> visit , for no one could look so ugly in bed as she did .
She had neither <unk> nor patches ; and her <unk> and <unk> skin , gave her more the appearance of a <unk> than of a living and amorous Fairy .
Her horn assisted in making her more hideous .
She had the fatal necklace round her neck , which was partly <unk> .
The King was not at all enchanted by the sight of her .
His desire to free himself from so hideous an object made him hastily draw forth his little bottle , in order to fling some drops of its <unk> over the Fairy , when all the Cupids suddenly began to cry , &quot; Who goes there ?
who goes there ? &quot;
The Fairy opened her eyes , and the King remained more surprised and more distressed than it is possible to say .
&quot; What do you here , Prince ? &quot;
said she , sitting <unk> ; &quot; what has brought you into my room without having sent me word of your intention ? &quot;
She would have asked him a thousand other questions if she had had the time , for the King , more alarmed at her ugliness than at the <unk> tone she gave to her words , allowed her to talk , and did not answer her .
&quot; What would you ? &quot;
she said again .
&quot; <unk> your object . &quot;
&quot; I am very sorry , Madam , to have disturbed your rest , &quot; at length said the King ; &quot; but not knowing your projects , before I <unk> <unk> my word to you I wish to know what you propose to exact from me . &quot;
&quot; Would there not have been time to-morrow , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; to have asked me this <unk> question , and was it necessary to awake me for so <unk> a purpose ?
Go to your rest , my Lord , and to-morrow we shall be in a condition for you to propose , and for me to resolve . &quot;
The King , truly seeing no other way of getting out of this embarrassment , was very well disposed to return to his room , when the Fairy called him back .
&quot; Come here , &quot; cried she , &quot; where are you going ?
<unk> you not to <unk> for your imprudence , or do you think you have not committed any ? &quot;
The King , annoyed by this fresh obstacle , which prevented him from retiring , said , &quot; Ah , Madam , do not make me commit a greater fault , in any longer <unk> your rest ; it ought to be precious to me , and the respect I owe <unk> &quot; &quot; No , no , &quot; replied the Fairy , &quot; approach ; I do not wish to sleep any more , and I will absolutely know what brought you here ; do not fear to offend me , but dread to conceal your feelings from me .
I wish for a <unk> avowal , and , &quot; continued she , looking at him most affectionately , &quot; I expect you will entertain me as a punishment for awaking me . &quot;
The King , at this disagreeable proposition , thought he should lose all patience , but being in the power of this terrible person he suppressed his first movement , and seating himself , out of respect , some distance from the Fairy &apos;s bed , said , &quot; Since you wish it , Madam , I will obey you .
I came , not thinking you were asleep , to ask you to restore the Princess to her natural form immediately , and to declare , without that , I cannot follow you to the temple of the rose-tree . &quot;
&quot; Truly , &quot; replied the Fairy , much annoyed at this commencement , &quot; this is a beautiful subject to disturb every one about ; could not that have been <unk> till to-morrow ? &quot;
&quot; No , Madam , &quot; replied the King , &quot; and I am very sorry I did not urge it yesterday , without being under the necessity of waiting another day . &quot;
&quot; Well , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; what will you do for me in return , and what have I to expect from your gratitude ? &quot;
&quot; I have told you , Madam , the strongest friendship , and all that an affectionate heart could further <unk> &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; replied the Fairy ; &quot; no , no , King Coquerico , it is not at such a price that I <unk> my <unk> must be of more value than that .
<unk> I tell you what it is ?
It is not worth while to wait till to-morrow to inform you .
I cannot ask you for your love , I am convinced of that ; you are incapable of feeling it for me ; you have made me sufficiently understand that ; but I will forgive you upon condition that to-morrow you will solemnly give me your faith . &quot;
The King , prepared as he had been for this event by Tigreline , could not quietly listen to her discourse , and find himself so near <unk> for ever a Princess whom he loved , without feeling it most cruelly .
&quot; If my heart were free , &quot; he replied , in a tone of voice changed by the excessive effort he made to suppress his fury , &quot; I could offer you the one or the other ; but , Madam , I have disposed of my heart beyond my own control , and I will not offer you my hand , the possession of which would make you miserable , for at every instant I should make you feel , in spite of myself , that , my heart being separated from it , I was not worthy the honour you conferred on me .
The gratitude I owe you , therefore , <unk> me absolutely to refuse you , at the peril of my life . &quot;
&quot; We shall see that to-morrow , &quot; replied Cornue .
&quot; Go and <unk> or change your noble <unk> ; but remember that if you resist mine , it will not be your life that will answer to me for it .
I shall know how to find , in spite of you , the <unk> place of a heart you assure me is so indifferent . &quot;
The King , <unk> by rage and grief , departed , and returned to his own apartments , where he abandoned himself to the deepest despair .
Twenty times he was about to plunge his sword in his heart , and sacrifice his life to the Princess ; but thinking he might perhaps revenge her , or at least save her from the fury of the Fairy , he abandoned that frightful idea , and resolved upon going to the temple of the Rose-tree .
As soon as the morning appeared , the palace of the Fairy resounded with music and <unk> <unk> ; she sent to know if the King was ready , giving an order that they should attend to him as her husband .
A pompous chariot was in the palace court .
All the fairies from far and near were summoned to this ceremony ; they arrived from every quarter .
Tigreline only announced that she should be at the temple .
At length the King appeared ; his pale and <unk> face indicated that he was the victim of the sacrifice , rather than the person to whom it was to be offered .
With all that he was as lovely as the day .
Cornue was attired as a Queen ; all the skill in the world had been employed about her robes .
She seated herself with the King in her chariot , and all the fairies followed according to their rank , riding upon <unk> , dragons , tigers , and <unk> .
A dozen beautiful young fairies of the Court of Cornue , led in <unk> a dozen lions , upon which , during all the journey , the King had his eyes fixed , seeking to discover if the unfortunate Lionette were not amongst them .
They set out amidst a <unk> of <unk> and trumpets , and they arrived at the <unk> of Eloquence : the flowers were already on the <unk> , and formed two <unk> six feet high , between which the brilliant <unk> passed , amidst loud acclamations and joyous songs .
The temple was <unk> .
The most beautiful flowers had formed two <unk> of exquisite taste , and the _ <unk> <unk> _ was enchanting , so well was everything arranged .
The unfortunate Lionette was already in the temple , and the pleasure of seeing Tigreline there , whom she remembered directly , had relieved in a slight degree the deep grief she was in at being compelled to witness the happiness of her cruel rival .
&quot; I shall die , Madam , &quot; said she to the Fairy , &quot; but at any rate let the King know , after my decease , that my affection has equalled his own , and that I pardon him a fault which fate has made him commit .
I do not condemn him for his inconstancy . &quot;
She wept so bitterly in <unk> these words , and she was so overcome by the violence of her grief , that she did not see the King and the Fairy enter .
Cornue first approached the Rose-tree .
&quot; I come , &quot; said she , &quot; to <unk> my word .
Divinity of this place , you demanded of me the sacrifice of a fowl .
I have too well understood your oracle ; behold what you required , and I think I shall <unk> your wishes by <unk> of him , at the foot of your altar , the hand he is so <unk> to bestow on me ; a sacrifice which is to him greater than that of his life . &quot;
The Rose-tree <unk> its leaves and <unk> , as if in <unk> of the words of the Fairy .
Cornue then turning to the King , who had remained a few steps behind her , said , &quot; Approach , my Lord , and fulfil the decree of fate . &quot;
He was at this moment much more occupied with what he saw than with what was said to him ; he had perceived Tigreline , and he no longer doubted that the lioness at her side was his divine Princess ; he looked at her tenderly and sorrowfully , not daring , however , to approach her , for fear of displeasing Tigreline , who had made him a severe sign to prevent him .
Cornue , surprised at his silence , turned towards him , and saw him in this pleasant occupation ; then placing on the altar the crown which she held in her hand , in order that the King might put it on her head , she approached him .
&quot; What are you about , &quot; said she ; &quot; is this a time for dreaming ? &quot;
&quot; I delay my reply , Madam , &quot; said the King , without much emotion , &quot; till you shall render to the Princess of the <unk> Island the form which you have so unjustly deprived her of ; afterwards I will do what gratitude demands of me , and I will not deceive you . &quot;
Cornue perceiving that it was not time to <unk> , especially as she saw Tigreline present , her superior in power , and that the day which she had chosen for this ceremony was precisely that on which the fairies are subject to death , was very <unk> not to let the King know this , for fear that he should take advantage of those <unk> hours to revenge himself for the cruelty which she had <unk> on him and the Princess ; yet , nevertheless , she was not willing to delay the fulfilment of her happiness ; knowing , therefore , that it was impossible to deceive the King any longer , she turned to Tigreline , who led the lioness to the altar .
&quot; My Sister , &quot; said Cornue , taking off the necklace and presenting it to Tigreline , &quot; I restore the Princess to you , and you can use your power to make her resume her proper form , but spare her the grief of seeing me crowned by the hand of her lover , and depart with her , as she can never be his . &quot;
Tigreline lost not a moment : in lieu of <unk> to Cornue , the good Fairy touched the lioness with her wand , and the Princess stood before them more beautiful and more amiable than ever .
She was by the care of the Fairy clothed magnificently and in the finest taste : she had a dress of cloth of silver , covered with garlands of <unk> flower of _ <unk> _ &#91; <unk> &#93; colour ; her beautiful light hair , adorned with diamonds and the same sort of flowers as those on her dress , fell in curls on her shoulders , and made her appear more beautiful than the day .
The King was transported : he advanced towards her , and falling on one <unk> &quot; Will you permit , beautiful Princess , &quot; said he , &quot; that the faith which I have plighted you should be taken from you , and that the unjust Fairy , who has made us so unhappy , should quietly enjoy a crown which should be yours ? &quot;
The Princess Lionette , during the time that her lover was speaking , kept her eyes tenderly fixed upon him , and by the tears which gently rolled down her cheeks let him see the effort which she made in giving him up .
&quot; I cannot , &quot; said she at length , &quot; oppose fate ; yes , my dear Prince , you must submit ; I release you from your vows , live happy without me , if it be possible for you to do so ; and as I must of necessity lose you , I quit this life without a regret , and am happy in dying at having been able to tell you once more without its being a crime that I love you . &quot;
&quot; Yes , you shall die , &quot; cried the furious Cornue ; &quot; I have borne enough <unk> , and that is another happiness which you have not counted amongst those you boast of at this fatal moment ! &quot;
The King at these words rose from the feet of the Princess , who did not seem alarmed even at seeing her rival advance towards her with a poniard in her hand .
He arrested the Fairy with one hand , and with the other drew his sword .
&quot; It is I who will perish , &quot; cried he , &quot; and you cannot attempt the life of my Princess , which mine will answer for . &quot;
&quot; Oh , heavens ! &quot;
cried the Fairy and Lionette at the same time .
&quot; Hold ! &quot;
Tigreline then advanced towards Cornue ; she had not spoken till that moment ; she had allowed everything to proceed , and those to speak who were most anxious to do so .
She raised her wand , and touching Cornue , &quot; <unk> , &quot; said she , &quot; to-day , the reward of your <unk> , and witness in your turn the happiness of these two lovers . &quot;
At the words Cornue remained motionless , but her eyes shone with such terrible fury , that , not being able to find expression for it , her horn seemed on fire , and she <unk> with rage .
&quot; And you , wise Rose-tree , &quot; continued Tigreline , &quot; resume your form , and enjoy the pleasure of embracing your amiable daughter . &quot;
She had not finished these words when the Rose-tree , <unk> itself a little , appeared in its true form .
It was that of a man about fifty years of age , <unk> made , and magnificently attired ; he had a long <unk> mantle , and a crown of gold , set with precious stones , on his head .
Lionette resembled him so extremely that no one in the whole assembly could doubt she was his daughter .
That beautiful Princess threw herself into his arms with so much natural delight , that all the company were affected by it .
The good King received her with transports of joy , which would have been more prolonged if he had not perceived at his feet the young King of the Fortunate Islands , who embraced his knees .
He quitted his daughter a moment to raise the handsome Coquerico .
&quot; I give you my daughter , &quot; said he to him , embracing him .
&quot; <unk> her , my Lord , and live as happily as I have seen you miserable .
I add my crown to this gift , and though I do not expect it will increase your happiness , <unk> by the <unk> it has brought on me , still , such as it is , I give it to my daughter to present to you . &quot;
At this moment the King would have taken off his crown , but the young King cried , &quot; No , sire , you shall not cease to reign : the charming , the tender Lionette <unk> all my wishes , and my crown is at her feet .
<unk> us to live with you , and let nothing separate us any more . &quot;
Tigreline <unk> this mark of generosity in King Coquerico ; and taking Lionette by the hand , she presented her to him .
He received her with transports of love more easily imagined than described .
Then raising his crown , and placing one <unk> on the ground , he presented it to Lionette , who accepted it as she plighted her <unk> to him .
The <unk> resounded with the <unk> <unk> .
It was only interrupted by Cornue , who uttered a piercing cry , and expired , it being her day of <unk> .
Her death caused no extraordinary sensation .
The young King and the Princess alone appeared affected by the result of her despair .
Tigreline had her carried away , and the ceremony was concluded .
King Coquerico then turning towards the King , his <unk> , asked him if he wished to witness the <unk> of the Queen Lionette , or if he would prefer waiting where he was for some days .
&quot; And I , &quot; said Lionette , &quot; I would <unk> a favour of the kind Tigreline , and of my dear husband , if I dare speak at this moment . &quot;
&quot; My dear Princess , &quot; replied the King , tenderly , &quot; what do you fear ? &quot;
&quot; I would , then , &quot; said the Princess , &quot; that , <unk> of the cares of government , we could live here always , and that , content with my happiness , I might be occupied with nothing but the pleasure of <unk> it .
It is here that I have regained what is to me most valuable .
What signifies to me the rest of the world if I live with these two persons ; and if you , Madam , &quot; added she , addressing the Fairy , &quot; deign to come and see me , and restore to me my two unfortunate guardians ? &quot;
&quot; I consent , &quot; said the two Kings at once .
&quot; Yes , my daughter , &quot; said the Fairy in her turn , &quot; I approve of these noble sentiments , and you shall live here as a Queen , but without feeling the inconvenience of it .
You shall both also enjoy the gift of <unk> .
I bestow it on you . &quot;
Then touching the hedges that formed the walls of the temple , the whole <unk> was changed into a palace of emeralds so brilliant and so magnificent , that never was anything seen to equal it .
The flowers became living and speaking persons , having as the sole mark of their transformation a flower of their name on the head .
The <unk> became a magnificent garden : on one side appeared a vast forest , at one end of which the Fairy caused to be built a little palace of rose-colour and white marble ; and at the other , one of rock crystal , in which she had the kindness to place the fine model of the universe , which had been the delight of the King in his youth .
The Princess was enchanted .
&quot; It is for me , &quot; said the King , &quot; an <unk> <unk> will recall to me without ceasing the pleasure I have enjoyed in <unk> it in search of my dear Princess . &quot;
&quot; And I , &quot; said she , &quot; will hold it dear , because it has taught you that I was occupied with your memory . &quot;
The Fairy was charmed to see them so happy , with a degree of love so little known in our time or even in that at which they lived .
&quot; Love each other always thus , my children , &quot; said she , embracing them ; &quot; I can give you nothing <unk> to that blessing ; it is the only real happiness . &quot;
She then made them observe that each palace had its separate gardens , its <unk> , fountains , and charming <unk> .
On the other side of the garden was a large and <unk> river , upon which were a thousand superb <unk> , silver and _ <unk> _ , which wound round towards a castle built entirely of flowers , the marvellous variety of which had an admirable effect , and <unk> the summit of a mountain with <unk> laid out as gardens , descending to the brink of the river , and which served as a country house to the Palace of <unk> .
&quot; I give you all this , &quot; said Tigreline , embracing Lionette ; &quot; live here , my children , <unk> of years ; your subjects will love you , and never betray you .
If you wish for more , a touch of this wand , &quot; said she , giving hers to Lionette , &quot; will change all the flowers into speaking and <unk> beings , and they will become flowers again at your will . &quot;
The King and Lionette threw themselves at the feet of the Fairy , and thanked her heartily .
She raised them , and again embraced them .
&quot; <unk> your wand , &quot; said she to the Princess , &quot; that your guardians may have the pleasure of being recalled by yourself . &quot;
The beautiful Lionette quickly made this first trial of her power ; the good people appeared immediately .
She ran to embrace them , but they feared to receive her caresses ; the beautiful Queen , however , pressed them to her heart so affectionately that they at length returned her <unk> with a tenderness which drew tears from all beholders .
The Queen seeing them so <unk> and <unk> , turned her beautiful eyes , full of tears , on the Fairy , who comprehended what she suffered .
&quot; I like to see so much <unk> , madam , &quot; said Tigreline ; &quot; use your power , you cannot employ it better than in the way you at present desire . &quot;
She had not finished these words , when the old man and his wife appeared to be , <unk> a man of twenty years , and the old woman a girl of eighteen .
They threw themselves at the feet of the Fairy , and kissed the hands of the Queen , who , delighted to see them so young and amiable , embraced the Fairy to thank her for this great favour .
The good King then addressed his daughter , who turned her eyes affectionately on him , &quot; Do not confer on me the same gift , my dear daughter ; I do not wish to possess second youth .
I see you happy , that is the only thing which would affect me ; I shall never be sensible of greater joy ; leave to the gods the disposal of my days . &quot;
&quot; It is for me , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; to render them happy ; you shall live , Sire , till you are sufficiently tired of life to wish to lose it .
Adieu ; my affairs compel me now to leave you , but I shall speedily see you again . &quot;
The Queen conducted the Fairy to her car , the two Kings handed her into it , after which they returned to the Palace , where , charmed with each other &apos;s society , they passed their golden days , more happy than they had ever been miserable .
They lived <unk> of years , and the King and Queen presented the world with fairies and <unk> <unk> , who are at this moment actually occupied in <unk> the happiness of the universe .

MADAME DE <unk> .
THE PRINCE DÉSIR and THE PRINCESS <unk> .
There was once upon a time a King who passionately loved a Princess , but she could not be married because she was enchanted .
He went in search of a Fairy to learn what he should do to be loved by this Princess .
The Fairy said to him , &quot; You know that the Princess has a large cat , of which she is very fond .
She is destined to marry the man who shall be sufficiently <unk> to <unk> on the tail of her cat . &quot;
The King said to himself , &quot; That will not be very difficult . &quot;
So he quitted the Fairy , determined to <unk> the tail of the cat rather than fail to <unk> on it .
He ran to the palace of his mistress , where Minon came towards him , putting up his back , as he was accustomed to do ; the King raised his foot , but when he thought he was certain to set it on the cat &apos;s tail , Minon turned round so quickly that his Majesty <unk> on nothing but the floor .
He tried for eight days to step on this fatal tail , but it appeared to be full of <unk> , so continually was it in <unk> .
At length the King had the good fortune to surprise Minon whilst he was sleeping , and <unk> upon his tail with all his force .
Minon awoke , <unk> horribly .
Then suddenly he took the form of a great man , and regarding the Prince with eyes full of anger , he said to him , &quot; Thou shalt <unk> the Princess , because thou hast destroyed the enchantment which prevented thee from doing so , but I will be avenged .
Thou shalt have a son who shall be always unhappy until the moment when he shall discover that he has too long a nose , and if thou <unk> to divulge the threat I have uttered , thou shalt die immediately . &quot;
Although the King was very frightened at the sight of this great man , who was an <unk> , he could not help laughing at this threat .
&quot; If my son has too long a nose , &quot; said he to himself , &quot; unless he be either blind or without arms , he can always see it or feel it . &quot;
The Enchanter having disappeared , the King sought the Princess , who consented to marry him ; but his happiness was of brief duration , for he died at the end of eight months .
A month afterwards the Queen brought into the world a little prince , whom they named Désir .
He had large blue eyes , the most beautiful in the world , and a pretty little mouth , but his nose was so <unk> that it covered half his face .
The Queen was inconsolable when she saw this great nose ; but the ladies who were with her told her that the nose was not so large as it appeared to her : that it was a <unk> nose , and that she might learn from history that all heroes had large noses .
The Queen , who passionately loved her son , was charmed at this discourse , and from constantly looking at Désir his nose did not appear so large to her as at first .
The Prince was brought up with care , and as soon as he could speak they told all sorts of <unk> stories before him about people with short noses .
They allowed no one to come near him but those whose noses in some degree resembled his own , and the courtiers , to pay their court to the Queen and her son , pulled the noses of their little children several times in the day to make them longer ; but it was no use pulling , for they appeared <unk> by the side of Prince Désir .
As soon as he could understand it they taught him history , and when they spoke of any great prince or beautiful princess they always said they had long noses .
All his apartments were full of portraits of persons with large noses , and Désir became so accustomed to regard the length of the nose as a beauty , that he would not for a crown have had his in the least diminished .
When he was twenty years of age , and they thought of marrying him , they presented him with the portraits of several princesses .
He was enchanted with that of Mignone .
She was the daughter of a great King , and heiress to several kingdoms ; but Désir thought nothing of that , so much was he engrossed by her beauty .
This Princess , whom he found so charming , had , however , a little <unk> nose , which had the prettiest effect in the world on her face , but which threw the courtiers into the utmost embarrassment .
They had acquired the habit of <unk> little noses , and they could not restrain a smile at that of the Princess , but Désir would allow no <unk> on this subject , and he banished from his court two courtiers who had dared to <unk> the nose of Mignone .
The others , <unk> by this example , corrected themselves , and there was one who said to the Prince , that in truth a man could not be handsome without a large nose , but that female beauty was altogether different , and that a <unk> who spoke <unk> had told him that he had read , in an old <unk> <unk> , that the beautiful <unk> had the <unk> of her nose turned up .
The Prince made a magnificent present to the person who told him this good news , and he sent ambassadors to demand Mignone &apos;s hand in marriage .
They granted his request , and he went more than three leagues to meet her , so anxious was he to behold her ; but when he advanced to kiss her hand , the Enchanter descended , carried off the Princess before his face , and left him inconsolable .
Désir resolved not to return to his kingdom till he had recovered Mignone .
He would not allow any of his courtiers to follow him , and being mounted on his good horse he put the <unk> on his neck and let him take his own road .
The horse entered a large plain , over which he travelled all day without seeing a single house .
The master and the horse were both dying of hunger , when at length in the evening the Prince saw a cavern , in which was a light .
He entered , and perceived a little woman , who appeared to be more than an hundred years old .
She put on her <unk> to look at the Prince , but she was a long time <unk> them , because her nose was too short .
The Prince and the Fairy ( for she was one ) each burst out laughing at seeing the other , and cried out both at once , &quot; Ah , what a <unk> nose ! &quot;
&quot; Not so <unk> as yours , &quot; said Désir to the Fairy ; &quot; but , Madam , let us leave our noses as they are , and be so good as to give me something to eat , for I am dying of hunger , and so is my poor horse . &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , &quot; said the Fairy ; &quot; although your nose is so ridiculous , you are no less the son of my best friend .
I loved the King your father like my own brother ; he had a very handsome nose , that Prince ! &quot;
&quot; And what is wanting in mine ? &quot;
said Désir .
&quot; Oh , there is nothing wanting , &quot; replied the Fairy ; &quot; on the contrary , there is but too much of it ; but never mind , one may be a very good man , even with too long a nose .
I have told you that I was the friend of your father ; he came to see me very often in those days ; and _ à <unk> _ of those days , let me tell you I was then very pretty , and he used to say so .
I must tell you a conversation we had together the last time that he saw me . &quot;
&quot; Oh , Madam , &quot; said Désir , &quot; I shall listen to you with much pleasure when I have supped ; think , I pray you , that I have not eaten all day . &quot;
&quot; Poor boy , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; he is right : I forgot all about that ; I will give you your supper directly , and whilst you eat I will tell you my history in few words , for I am not fond of long stories .
Too long a tongue is still more insupportable than a long nose , and I remember , when I was young , that I was admired because I was not a great talker ; they told the Queen my mother this , for notwithstanding what you now see me , I am the daughter of a great King .
My <unk> &quot; &quot; Your father ate when he was hungry , &quot; said the Prince , interrupting her .
&quot; Yes , without doubt , &quot; replied the Fairy , &quot; and you shall <unk> also , <unk> .
I wanted only to tell you that my <unk> &quot; &quot; And I will listen to nothing till I have eaten , &quot; said the Prince , who began to be in a passion .
He <unk> down , however , for he had need of the Fairy , and he said to her , &quot; I know that the pleasure I should have in listening to you would make me forget my hunger , but my horse , who will not hear you , has need of food . &quot;
The Fairy <unk> up at this compliment .
&quot; You shall not wait any longer , &quot; said she , <unk> her <unk> ; &quot; you are very <unk> , and notwithstanding the enormous size of your nose , you are very good looking . &quot;
&quot; <unk> take the old woman with my nose , &quot; said the Prince to himself ; &quot; one would imagine that my mother had <unk> from her the quantity of which her own nose is deficient .
If I did not so much want something to eat , I would leave this <unk> , who <unk> she <unk> so little .
One must be a great fool not to know his own defects : this comes of being born a Princess ; flatterers have <unk> her , and have persuaded her that she is a little talker . &quot;
Whilst the Prince was thus thinking , the servants laid the table , and he could not but wonder at the Fairy , who put a thousand questions to them merely for the pleasure of talking ; he admired , above all , a <unk> , who , whatever the Fairy said , praised her mistress for her discretion .
&quot; Well , &quot; thought he , whilst eating , &quot; I am charmed at having come here .
This example makes me see how wisely I have acted in not listening to flatterers .
Such people praise us <unk> , hide our defects from us , and change them into perfections : as for me , I shall never be their <unk> know my faults , thank God . &quot;
The poor Désir believed this thoroughly , and did not feel that those who had praised his nose <unk> him as much as the Fairy &apos;s <unk> <unk> her ( for the Prince saw that she turned <unk> from time to time to laugh ) .
As for him , he said not a word , but ate with all his might .
&quot; Prince , &quot; said the Fairy , when he began to be satisfied , &quot; turn yourself a little , I beg ; your nose <unk> a shadow which prevents my seeing what is on my plate .
Now , come , let us speak of your father : I went to his Court at the time that he was a little boy , but it is <unk> years since I retired to this solitude .
Tell me a little about the way they live at Court at present : the ladies , do they still love running from place to place ?
In my time , one saw them the same day at the assembly , at the <unk> , at the <unk> , at the <unk> long your nose is !
I cannot get accustomed to the sight of it ! &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; replied Désir , &quot; I wish you would cease to speak of my <unk> is as it <unk> does it matter to you ?
I am content with it , and I would not have it any shorter ; every one has his nose as it pleases Providence . &quot;
&quot; Oh !
I see plainly that you are angry , my poor Désir , &quot; said the Fairy ; &quot; it was not , however , my intention to <unk> you , quite the contrary , I am one of your friends , and I wish to render you a service ; but , in spite of that , I cannot help being <unk> at your nose ; I will , however , try not to speak of it , I will force myself even to think you are <unk> , although , to tell you the truth , there is enough material in that nose to make three reasonable noses . &quot;
Désir , who had supped , became so impatient at the <unk> talk which the Fairy kept up on the subject of his nose , that he threw himself on his horse and rode off .
He continued his journey , and wherever he passed he thought everybody was mad , because every one exclaimed at his nose ; but notwithstanding this , he had been so accustomed to hear it said that his nose was handsome , that he could never admit to himself that it was too long .
The old Fairy , who wished to render him a service in spite of himself , took it into her head to shut up Mignone in a crystal palace , and placed this palace in the road of the Prince .
Désir , transported with joy , strove to break it , but he could not succeed ; in despair , he wished to approach so as at least to speak to the Princess , who , on her part also stretched out her hand close to the glass .
He wished to kiss this hand , but whichever way he turned he could not get his mouth near it , because his nose prevented him .
He perceived , for the first time , its extraordinary length , and putting his hand to it to <unk> it on one side , &quot; It must be confessed , &quot; said he , &quot; that my nose is too long . &quot;
At that moment the crystal palace fell to pieces , and the old woman , who held Mignone by the hand , said to the Prince , &quot; <unk> that you are under a great obligation to me ; I might have spoken in vain to you of your nose , you would never have believed in the defect had it not become an obstacle to the <unk> of your wishes . &quot;
It is thus that self-love <unk> from us the <unk> of our soul and body .
<unk> in vain <unk> to <unk> them to us , we do not admit them till the moment when this same self-love <unk> them contrary to its interest .
Désir , whose nose had now become an ordinary one , profited by this lesson ; he married Mignone , and lived happily with her for a great number of years .
PRINCE CHÉRI .
There was once upon a time so excellent a monarch that his subjects called him King Good .
One day , when he was hunting , a little white rabbit which the dogs were about to kill , jumped into his arms .
The King caressed the little rabbit , and said , &quot; As it has put itself under my protection , I will not allow any harm to be done to it . &quot;
He carried the little rabbit into his palace and gave it a pretty little house and <unk> <unk> to eat .
At night , when he was alone in his chamber , a beautiful lady appeared before him ; she was <unk> neither in gold nor in silver , but her robe was white as snow , and her head-dress consisted simply of a crown of white roses .
The good King was much surprised to see this lady , as his door was locked , and he knew not how she had entered .
She said to him , &quot; I am the Fairy Candid ; I passed through the wood as you were hunting , and I wished to ascertain if you were as good as everybody said you were .
For that purpose I took the form of a little rabbit , and I saved myself by jumping into your arms ; for I know that those who have pity for animals have more still for men ; and if you had refused me your assistance I should have thought you wicked .
I come to thank you for the kindness you have shown me , and to assure you I shall always be your friend .
You have only to ask me for anything you wish , I promise to grant it . &quot;
&quot; Madam , &quot; said the good King , &quot; as you are a Fairy , you ought to know all I wish for .
I have but one son , whom I love exceedingly , and on that account they have named him Prince Chéri ; if you have any affection for me , become the friend of my son . &quot;
&quot; With all my heart , &quot; said the Fairy ; &quot; I can make your son the handsomest Prince in the world , or the richest , or the most powerful ; choose which you wish him to be . &quot;
&quot; I desire none of those things for my son , &quot; said the good King ; &quot; but I shall be much obliged if you will make him the best of all Princes .
What will it profit him to be handsome , rich , to have all the kingdoms of the world , if he should be wicked ?
You know well he would be miserable , and that nothing but virtue can make him happy . &quot;
&quot; You are quite right , &quot; said Candid ; &quot; but it is not in my power to make the Prince Chéri a good man in spite of himself ; he must himself endeavour to become virtuous .
All I can promise you is to give him good advice , to point out to him his faults , and to punish him if he will not correct them and punish himself . &quot;
The good King was quite content with this promise , and died a short time afterwards .
Prince Chéri wept much for his father , for he loved him with all his heart , and he would have given all his kingdoms , his gold , and his silver , to have saved him , if such things had power to change the will of fate .
Two years after the death of the good King , Chéri being in bed , Candid appeared to him .
&quot; I promised your father , &quot; said she to him , &quot; to be your friend ; and , to keep my word , I come to make you a present . &quot;
At the same time she placed on the finger of Chéri a little gold ring , and said to him , &quot; <unk> this ring <unk> is more precious than diamonds .
Every time you commit a bad action it will <unk> your finger ; but if in spite of this <unk> you <unk> in the evil deed , you will lose my friendship , and I shall become your enemy . &quot;
Candid disappeared as she uttered these words , and left Chéri much astonished .
For some time his conduct was so <unk> that the ring did not <unk> him at all , and this gave him so much gratification , that his subjects added to his name Chéri , or <unk> , that of <unk> , or Happy .
One day he went out hunting , and caught nothing , which put him in a bad humour .
It appeared to him , then , that the ring pressed his finger a little ; but as it did not <unk> him he paid no great attention to it .
On entering his apartment , however , his little dog <unk> came jumping about him affectionately , when he said , &quot; <unk> thee gone , I am not in a humour to receive thy caresses ! &quot;
The poor little dog , who did not understand him , pulled at his <unk> , to oblige him at least to look at him .
This irritated Chéri , and he gave him a violent <unk> .
In a moment the ring pricked him , as if it had been a <unk> ; he was much astonished , and seated himself , quite ashamed , in a corner of the room .
&quot; I think the Fairy <unk> me , &quot; said he to himself .
&quot; What great evil have I done in <unk> an animal which <unk> me ?
Of what use is it to be master of a great empire if I may not <unk> my own dog ? &quot;
&quot; I do not <unk> you , &quot; said a voice which replied to the thoughts of Chéri .
&quot; You have committed three faults instead of one .
You have been in an ill-humour because you did not like to be <unk> , and because you believe both beasts and men were only made to obey you .
You put yourself in a passion , which is very wrong , and , <unk> , you have been cruel to a poor animal that did not deserve to be ill-treated .
I know you are much superior to a dog ; but if it were a reasonable thing , and <unk> for the great to <unk> those who are beneath them , I would at this moment beat <unk> you , for a Fairy is stronger than a man .
The advantage of being master of a great empire is not to be able to do all the harm that you may wish , but all the good that you can . &quot;
Chéri confessed his fault , and promised to correct it ; but he did not keep his word .
He had been <unk> by a foolish nurse , who had <unk> him when he was little .
If he wanted anything he had only to cry , <unk> , and <unk> his foot , and this woman gave him all he wished for ; and this had made him <unk> .
She had told him also , from morning to night , that he would be King some day , and that kings were very happy , because everybody must obey them , and treat them with great respect , and that no one could prevent their doing whatever they pleased .
When Chéri grew up , and was capable of <unk> , he soon learnt that there was nothing so odious as to be proud , vain , and <unk> .
He made some efforts to correct himself , but he had unfortunately <unk> all three defects ; and a bad habit is very difficult to <unk> .
It was not that he had naturally a bad heart : he wept with annoyance when he had committed a fault , and said , &quot; How unfortunate am I in having to fight thus all my days against my pride and my temper !
If they had corrected me when I was young , I should not now have had so much trouble . &quot;
His ring pricked him very often .
Sometimes he stopped immediately , at others he persisted in his <unk> ; and what was very singular was , that it pricked him very slightly for a light offence , but when he did anything really wicked , it would make the blood <unk> from his finger .
At length he grew impatient at this , and wishing to <unk> at his ease , he threw away his ring .
He thought himself the happiest of men when he was released from its <unk> .
He abandoned himself to all the follies which entered his head , till at length he became quite wicked , and nobody could bear him .
One day that Chéri was out walking he saw a young maiden so beautiful , that he determined to marry her .
She was called Zélie , and she was as good as she was pretty .
Chéri imagined that Zélie would be most happy to become a great Queen ; but the girl told him , with much firmness , &quot; Sire , I am only a shepherdess ; I have no fortune ; but in spite of that , I will not marry you . &quot;
&quot; <unk> I displeasing to you ? &quot;
asked Chéri , a little offended .
&quot; No , Prince , &quot; replied Zélie ; &quot; I think you are very handsome ; but what would be the advantage to me of your beauty , your riches , the fine clothes and magnificent <unk> which you would give me , if the bad actions I should daily see you commit forced me to <unk> and hate you ? &quot;
Chéri became enraged with Zélie , and ordered his officers to carry her by force to his palace .
He <unk> all day long over the contempt with which this girl had treated him ; but as he loved her , he could not make up his mind to harm her .
<unk> the <unk> of Chéri was his <unk> , whom he had made his <unk> .
This man , whose inclinations were as low as his birth , flattered the passions of his master , and gave him very bad advice .
When he saw Chéri so sad , he asked the cause of his grief .
The Prince having replied that he could not bear the contempt of Zélie , and that he had determined to correct himself of his faults , because he must be virtuous to please her , this wicked man said , &quot; You are very good to give yourself so much trouble for a little girl .
If I were in your place , I would force her to obey me .
<unk> that you are King , and that it would be a shame for you to submit to the will of a shepherdess , who should be only too happy to be amongst your slaves .
<unk> her fast on bread and water ; put her in prison ; and if she continue to refuse to marry you , let her die by torture , in order to teach others to yield to your wishes .
You will be <unk> if it be known that a simple girl <unk> your pleasure , and all your subjects will forget that they are placed in this world only to serve you . &quot;
&quot; But , &quot; said Chéri , &quot; shall I not be <unk> if I put to death an innocent girl ?
For in fact Zélie is guilty of no crime . &quot;
&quot; No one is innocent who <unk> to obey your commands , &quot; replied the <unk> .
&quot; But suppose you do commit an injustice , it is better to be accused of that than to let it be known that it is permitted to be wanting in respect for you or to <unk> you . &quot;
The <unk> knew Chéri &apos;s weak point ; and the fear of seeing his authority diminished made such an impression on the King , that he <unk> the good impulse which had given him the wish to correct himself .
He resolved to go the same evening into the chamber of the shepherdess , and to <unk> her if she still refused to marry him .
The <unk> of Chéri , who feared some good change in him , assembled three young lords as wicked as himself to <unk> with the King .
They supped together ; and the courtiers took care to cloud the reason of the poor Prince , by making him drink deep .
During the repast they excited his anger against Zélie , and made him so ashamed of the tenderness he had shown for her , that he rose like a <unk> , <unk> that he would make her obey him , or sell her the next day as a slave .
Chéri having entered the chamber in which the girl had been shut up , was surprised not to find her there , for he had the key in his pocket .
He was in a frightful rage , and swore to be avenged on those whom he should suspect of having <unk> her to escape .
His <unk> hearing him speak thus , resolved to profit by his anger to rid themselves of a nobleman who had been Chéri &apos;s governor .
This worthy man had occasionally taken the liberty of pointing out to the King his faults , for he loved him as though he had been his own son .
At first Chéri had thanked him , but at length he grew impatient at being contradicted , and then began to think it was only from a spirit of opposition that his governor found fault with him , whilst every one else praised him .
He ordered him , therefore , to retire from Court ; but , notwithstanding this order , he admitted now and then that he was an honest man ; that he no longer loved him , but that he <unk> him in spite of himself .
The <unk> were always in dread of the King <unk> the governor , and they now imagined they had found a favourable opportunity of getting rid of him altogether .
They represented to the King that Suliman ( such was the name of the worthy man ) had boasted that he would set Zélie at liberty .
They <unk> three men , who <unk> that they had overheard Suliman speak to this effect ; and the Prince , transported with anger , commanded his <unk> to send a guard to bring the governor to him <unk> like a criminal .
After having given these orders , Chéri retired to his room ; but hardly had he entered it , when the ground trembled , he heard a <unk> clap of thunder , and Candid appeared before him .
&quot; I promised your father , &quot; said she to him , in a severe tone , &quot; to give you advice , and to punish you if you refused to follow it .
You have <unk> that advice ; you have retained but the form of a man ; your crimes have changed you into a monster , the horror of <unk> and earth .
It is time I should fulfil my promise by <unk> you .
I condemn you to become like the beasts whose inclinations you already copy .
You have resembled the lion in your rage , the wolf in your <unk> , the serpent by <unk> him who has been your second father , and the <unk> by your <unk> .
You shall bear in your new form the trace of all these animals . &quot;
Hardly had she finished these words before Chéri saw with horror he was the monster she described .
He had the head of a lion , the horns of a <unk> , the feet of a wolf , and the tail of a <unk> .
At the same time he found himself in a great forest , on the brink of a fountain wherein he saw his horrible form reflected , and heard a voice , which said , &quot; <unk> attentively the state to which thy crimes have reduced thee .
Thy mind is become a thousand times more frightful than thy body . &quot;
Chéri recognised the voice of Candid , and in his fury he turned to throw himself on her , and , if it had been possible , to devour her ; but he saw no one , and the same voice said to him , &quot; I <unk> thy <unk> fury , and will humble thy pride by placing thee under the power of thine own subjects . &quot;
Chéri thought that by flying from this fountain he should escape from much of his vexation , as he should no longer have his ugliness and deformity before his eyes : he rushed therefore into the wood ; but hardly had he gone a few steps , when he fell into a hole which had been made to catch a bear , and immediately the hunters , who had <unk> the trees to watch for their prey , descended , and having <unk> him with chains , led him towards the capital city of his kingdom .
On the way , instead of perceiving that he had drawn on himself this <unk> by his own fault , he <unk> the Fairy , <unk> his chains , and gave himself up to his rage .
As he approached the city to which they were conducting him , he observed great <unk> going on ; and the hunters having asked what had happened , were told that Prince Chéri , who had had no pleasure but in <unk> his people , had been destroyed in his chamber by a <unk> , for so they imagined .
&quot; The gods , &quot; said they , &quot; could no longer support the excess of his wickedness , and have thus ridden the world of him .
Four lords , <unk> of his crimes , thought to profit by the event , and to <unk> his kingdom amongst them ; but the people who knew that it was their evil <unk> which had <unk> the King , tore them to pieces , and have offered the crown to Suliman , whom the wicked Chéri had wished to put to death .
This worthy Lord has just been crowned , and we celebrate this day as that of the <unk> of the kingdom ; for Suliman is virtuous , and will restore to us peace and prosperity . &quot;
Chéri groaned with rage at hearing this discourse ; but it was far worse when he arrived in the Great <unk> before the Palace .
He saw Suliman on a superb throne , and heard the people wish him a long life , to repair all the evils which his <unk> had committed .
Suliman made a sign with his hand to request silence , and said to the crowd : &quot; I have accepted the crown which you offered me , but only to preserve it for Prince Chéri ; he is not dead , as you believe .
A Fairy has revealed this to me , and perhaps some day you will see him again as virtuous as he was in his youth .
Alas ! &quot;
continued he , shedding tears , &quot; flatterers <unk> him .
I knew his heart , it was formed for virtue ; and but for the <unk> discourse of those who surrounded him , he would have been a father to you .
<unk> his vices , but pity him , and let us all pray the gods to restore him to us .
As for me , I should esteem myself too happy to bathe this throne with my blood , if I could see him ascend it again with those good <unk> which would make him fill it worthily . &quot;
The words of Suliman went to the heart of Chéri .
He found then how sincere had been the attachment and fidelity of this excellent man , and for the first time reproached himself for his wickedness .
Hardly had he listened to this good impulse than he felt the rage which had animated him subdued , he reflected on the crimes he had committed , and confessed he had not been punished as severely as he had deserved .
He ceased to struggle in his iron cage , and became <unk> as a lamb .
They placed him in a large <unk> , where they kept all sorts of monsters and wild beasts , and <unk> him up with the rest .
Chéri then came to the resolution of beginning to <unk> of his faults , by showing obedience to the man who kept him .
This man was very <unk> when he was in an <unk> .
Although the Monster was very <unk> , he beat him without <unk> or reason .
One day that this man was asleep , a tiger that had broken his chain threw himself upon him to devour him ; at first Chéri felt an emotion of joy at seeing himself about to be delivered from his <unk> , but immediately after he condemned this feeling and wished himself at liberty .
&quot; I would , &quot; said he , &quot; render good for evil by saving the life of this unhappy man . &quot;
Hardly had he formed the wish , than he saw his iron cage open , he threw himself before the man , who was now awake and defending himself from the tiger .
The <unk> thought himself lost when he saw the Monster ; but his fear was soon turned into <unk> <unk> Monster <unk> upon the tiger , <unk> him , and then laid himself down at the feet of him whom he had saved .
The man , penetrated by gratitude , was about to <unk> to <unk> the Monster which had rendered him so great a service , when he heard a voice which said , &quot; A good action never goes without its reward , &quot; and at the same moment he saw only a pretty dog at his feet .
Chéri , charmed at this metamorphosis , bestowed a thousand caresses on his <unk> , who took him in his arms and carried him to the King , to whom he related this marvellous story .
The Queen desired to have the dog ; and Chéri would have been very happy in his new condition had he been able to forget that he was once a man and a monarch .
The Queen loaded him with caresses ; but fearing that he would <unk> larger , she consulted her <unk> , who told her that she must give him no food but bread , and only a moderate quantity of that .
Poor Chéri was dying of hunger half the day , but he was obliged to have patience .
One morning that they brought him his little <unk> for his breakfast , he had a fancy to go and eat it in the garden of the Palace .
He took it in his mouth , and walked towards a canal which he knew was a short distance off ; but he could nowhere find it , and in its place he saw a large mansion , the exterior of which <unk> with gold and precious stones .
He observed in it an immense number of persons of both sexes magnificently dressed : they sang and danced , and <unk> <unk> within the building ; but all those who came out of it were pale , <unk> , covered with <unk> , and nearly naked , for their clothes were torn into <unk> .
Some fell dead as they issued from it without having strength to <unk> themselves a step further ; others proceeded with great difficulty ; whilst some remained lying on the ground dying of hunger and begging a morsel of bread from those who entered the house , but who did not <unk> a look at them .
Chéri approached a young girl who was trying to tear up some grass to eat ; touched with compassion , the Prince said to himself , &quot; I have a good appetite , but I shall not die of hunger if I wait till <unk> and sacrifice my breakfast to this poor creature ; perhaps I shall save her life . &quot;
He resolved to act on this good impulse , and placed his bread in the hand of the girl , who put it to her mouth with <unk> .
She soon appeared quite restored by it ; and Chéri , transported with joy at having so <unk> come to her relief , was about to return to the Palace when he heard loud cries .
It was Zélie in the hands of four men , who dragged her towards the mansion , which they forced her to enter .
Chéri then regretted his form of a monster , which would have afforded him the means of <unk> Zélie ; but a poor little dog as he was , he could only <unk> at the <unk> and <unk> to follow them .
They drove him away by <unk> ; but he resolved not to quit the spot , and find out what had become of Zélie .
He reproached himself for the misfortunes of this beautiful girl .
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
said he to himself , &quot; I am indignant with those who have carried her off .
Have I not committed the same crime myself ?
and if the justice of the gods had not <unk> my attempt , should I not have treated her with the same barbarity ? &quot;
The reflections of Chéri were interrupted by a noise which he heard above his head .
He saw a window open ; and his joy was extreme when he perceived Zélie , who threw from this window a <unk> of meat so well dressed that it made him hungry to see it .
The window was shut again immediately ; and Chéri , who had not eaten all day , was about to devour the meat , when the young girl to whom he had given the bread uttered a cry , and having taken him in her arms , &quot; Poor little animal , &quot; said she , &quot; do not touch that food ; this house is the Palace of <unk> ; all who come out of it are <unk> . &quot;
At the same moment Chéri heard a voice which said , &quot; Thou <unk> a good action never remains <unk> ; &quot; and immediately he was changed into a beautiful little white pigeon .
He remembered that this colour was the favourite one of Candid , and began to hope that she might at length restore him to her good graces .
He was desirous of <unk> Zélie ; and rising in the air , flew all round the palace , and found with joy one window open ; but in vain did he traverse all the <unk> could not find Zélie .
In despair at her loss , he resolved not to rest till he should meet with her .
He flew for several days , and having entered a desert , observed a cavern , which he approached .
How great was his delight !
Zélie was seated there by the side of a <unk> hermit , and sharing with him a <unk> repast .
Chéri , transported with joy , flew on to the shoulder of the lovely shepherdess , and expressed by his caresses the pleasure he felt at seeing her .
Zélie , charmed with the gentleness of the little creature , <unk> it gently with her hand , and although she thought it could not understand her , she told it that she accepted the gift it made her of itself , and that she would always love it .
&quot; What have you done , Zélie ? &quot;
said the hermit .
&quot; You have plighted your faith . &quot;
&quot; Yes , charming shepherdess , &quot; said Chéri to her , who resumed at this moment his natural form , &quot; the termination of my metamorphosis was <unk> on your consent to our union .
You have promised always to love me , <unk> my happiness , or I shall hasten and implore the Fairy Candid , my <unk> , to restore me to the form under which I have had the happiness of pleasing you . &quot;
&quot; You need not fear her inconstancy , &quot; said Candid , who , quitting the form of the hermit under which she had been concealed , appeared before them in her proper person .
&quot; Zélie loved you from the first moment she saw you ; but your vices compelled her to conceal the passion with which you had inspired her .
The change in your heart leaves her at liberty to show her affection for you .
You will live happily , because your union will be founded on virtue . &quot;
Chéri and Zélie threw themselves at the feet of Candid .
The Prince was never tired of <unk> her for her goodness , and Zélie , enchanted to find that the Prince <unk> his former evil ways , confirmed to him the Fairy &apos;s avowal of her affection .
&quot; <unk> , my children , &quot; said the Fairy to them , &quot; I will transport you to your Palace , and restore to Chéri a crown of which his vices had rendered him unworthy . &quot;
Hardly had she finished speaking when they found themselves in the chamber of Suliman , who , charmed to see his dear master once more become virtuous , <unk> the throne , and remained the most faithful of his subjects .
Chéri reigned for a long period with Zélie ; and it is said that he applied himself so well to his duties , that the ring , which he again wore , never once pricked his finger severely enough to draw a single drop of blood .
THE WIDOW AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS .
Once upon a time there was a Widow , a very worthy woman , who had two daughters , both of whom were very amiable ; the eldest was named Blanche , the second Vermeille .
They had been given these names because the first had the fairest complexion in the world , and the second cheeks and lips as red as <unk> or the finest coral .
One day the good Widow , sitting at her door spinning , saw a poor old woman , who could with difficulty walk , even with the aid of a stick .
&quot; You seem very tired , &quot; said the good Widow to the old creature ; &quot; sit down a moment and rest , &quot; and immediately desired her daughter to place a <unk> for her .
They both rose directly , but Vermeille ran <unk> than her sister and brought the <unk> .
&quot; Will you take something to drink ? &quot;
said the good woman to the old one .
&quot; With all my heart , &quot; replied she ; &quot; I could even eat something , if you could give me a morsel to refresh me . &quot;
&quot; I will give you all in my power , &quot; said the good Widow : &quot; but I am poor , and it will not be much . &quot;
At the same time she told her daughters to attend on the old woman , who placed herself at the table ; and the good Widow told her eldest daughter to go and gather some plums from a tree which the young girl had <unk> herself , and of which she was very fond .
Blanche , instead of obeying her mother cheerfully , murmured against this order , and said to herself , &quot; It was not for this old <unk> creature that I have taken so much care of my <unk> . &quot;
She dared not refuse , however , to gather some of the plums ; but she did so with an ill grace , and <unk> .
&#91; Illustration : The Widow and her Two <unk>
<unk> . &#93;
&quot; And you , Vermeille , &quot; said the good woman to her second daughter , &quot; you have no fruit to give this good lady , for your <unk> are not yet <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> , &quot; said Vermeille , &quot; but I hear my <unk> <unk> ; she has just laid an <unk> , and if <unk> will like to eat it warm I will give it her with all my heart . &quot;
At the same time , without awaiting the reply of the old woman , she ran to fetch her <unk> ; but at the same moment that she presented it to the stranger she disappeared , and they saw in her place a beautiful lady , who said to the mother , &quot; I am about to reward your two daughters according to their deserts .
The eldest shall become a great Queen , the second a farmer &apos;s wife . &quot;
At the same time striking the cottage with her stick , it disappeared , and they saw in its place a pretty farm .
&quot; There is your lot , &quot; said she to Vermeille .
&quot; I know that I have given to each that which she will like best . &quot;
The Fairy departed as she uttered these words , and the mother , as well as her two daughters , remained struck with astonishment .
They entered the <unk> , and were charmed with the style of the furniture .
The <unk> were only of wood , but they were so polished that they could see themselves reflected in them as in a mirror .
The <unk> was white as snow .
In the <unk> there were twenty <unk> and as many sheep , four <unk> , four <unk> , and in the <unk> all kinds of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &amp; c . There was also a pretty garden , filled with fruits and flowers .
Blanche saw without envy the present which had been made to her sister , and <unk> in the delightful <unk> of being a Queen .
<unk> she heard hunters passing , and going to the door to see them , she appeared so beautiful in the eyes of the King , who was returning from the chase , that he resolved immediately to marry her .
Blanche having become Queen , said to her sister Vermeille , &quot; I will not have you remain a farmer ; come with me , sister , and I will give you in marriage to a great lord . &quot;
&quot; I am much obliged , sister , &quot; replied Vermeille , &quot; but I am accustomed to the country , and wish to remain there . &quot;
For the first few months Queen Blanche was so much occupied with balls , fine clothes , and <unk> , that she thought of nothing else .
But she soon became accustomed to such things , and they amused her no longer ; on the contrary , she became very miserable .
All the ladies of the Court paid her great respect in her presence , but she knew that they did not like her , and that they said amongst themselves , &quot; <unk> at this little peasant , how she <unk> the fine lady : the King had a very low taste to choose such a wife . &quot;
This kind of conversation made the King reflect .
He began to think he had done wrong in marrying Blanche , and as his love for her declined he neglected her , and passed his time with the handsomest ladies of his Court .
When it was perceived that the King no longer loved his wife , the courtiers ceased to pay her any respect .
She was very unhappy , for she had not a single real friend to whom she could relate her <unk> .
She saw that it was the fashion at Court to betray friends for interested motives , to appear to love those whom they hated , and to tell <unk> every moment .
She was obliged to look serious , because they said a Queen ought to have a grave and majestic air .
She had several children , and during all this time she had a <unk> continually attending her , who examined everything she ate , and took from her everything she liked .
They put no <unk> in her soup ; they forbade her to walk when she was inclined to do so ; in a word , she was contradicted from morning till night .
They gave <unk> to her children , who brought them up very <unk> , without her having the liberty to find fault .
Poor Blanche was near dying of grief , and she became so <unk> that she excited the <unk> of everybody .
She had not seen her sister during the three years that she had been Queen , because she thought that a person of her rank would be <unk> by <unk> a farmer ; but being overcome with melancholy , she resolved at length to go and pass some days in the country to amuse herself a little .
She asked permission of the King , who willingly granted it , because he thought it would be a good <unk> .
On her road she came to the farm of Vermeille , and at a distance she saw before the door a troop of shepherds and shepherdesses , dancing and amusing themselves with all their hearts .
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
said the Queen , sighing , &quot; when shall I ever <unk> myself like these poor people , with no one to find fault with me ? &quot;
As soon as she appeared her sister ran to her to embrace her .
She had such a contented air , she was <unk> so <unk> , that the Queen could not help crying at seeing her .
Vermeille had married a young peasant who had no fortune , but he always remembered that he was indebted to his wife for all that he possessed , and he sought , by his <unk> manner , to mark his gratitude for her .
Vermeille had not many servants , but they were as fond of her as if they had been her children , because she treated them as such .
All her neighbours also loved her , and all sought to give her proof of it .
She had not much money , but she had no need of it , for she obtained from her land <unk> , wine , and <unk> in <unk> .
Her flocks furnished her with milk , with which she made <unk> and cheese .
She <unk> the wool of her sheep to make clothes for herself , as well as for her husband , and for two children which she had .
They were in wonderfully good health ; and in the evenings , when their work was done , they amused themselves with all kinds of games .
&quot; Alas ! &quot;
cried the Queen , &quot; the Fairy has made me an unlucky present in <unk> on me a crown .
Happiness is not to be found in magnificent palaces , but in the innocent occupations of the country . &quot;
Hardly had she uttered these words when the Fairy appeared .
&quot; I intended not to reward you but to punish you by making you a Queen , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; because you <unk> giving me your plums .
In order to be happy , you must , like your sister , only possess such things as are necessary , and wish for no more . &quot;
&quot; Ah !
Madam , &quot; cried Blanche , &quot; you are sufficiently revenged .
<unk> my misery . &quot;
&quot; It is ended , &quot; replied the Fairy ; &quot; the King , who loves you no longer , has just <unk> you to marry another wife , and to-morrow his officers will come to order you , in his name , not to return to the palace . &quot;
This occurred as the Fairy had predicted .
Blanche passed the rest of her days with her sister Vermeille in peace and happiness , and never thought of the court but to thank the Fairy for having brought her back to the village .
PRINCE FATAL AND PRINCE FORTUNÉ .
There was once upon a time a Queen who had two little boys , who were perfectly beautiful .
A Fairy , who was a great friend of the Queen , had been requested to be godmother to these Princes , and to endow each with some gift .
&quot; I endow the eldest , &quot; said she , &quot; with all sorts of misfortunes until he <unk> the age of <unk> , and I name him Fatal . &quot;
At these words the Queen uttered piercing cries , and conjured the Fairy to change her gift .
&quot; You know not what you ask , &quot; said she to the Queen .
&quot; If he be not unfortunate , he will be wicked . &quot;
The Queen dared say no more , but she begged the Fairy to allow her to choose a gift for her second son .
&quot; <unk> you will make a bad choice , &quot; replied the Fairy ; &quot; but never <unk> will agree to give him all that you shall request of me for him . &quot;
&quot; I wish , &quot; said the Queen , &quot; that he may succeed always in everything he may desire to <unk> is the way to make him perfect . &quot;
&quot; You may be deceived , &quot; said the Fairy ; &quot; therefore I grant him this gift only for <unk> years . &quot;
They selected nurses for the two little Princes ; but on the third day the nurse of the eldest Prince caught a <unk> ; they gave him another , who fell and broke her <unk> ; a third lost her milk as soon as she was appointed .
And the report being spread that the Prince brought misfortune on all his nurses , no one would <unk> him or approach him .
The poor child , who was <unk> , cried , and no one pitied him .
A fine <unk> <unk> , who had a great number of children whom she had much trouble in <unk> , said that she would take care of him if they would give her a large sum of money ; and as the King and Queen did not like Prince Fatal , they gave the nurse what she asked , and told her to carry him to her village .
The second Prince , whom they had named Fortuné , got on wonderfully .
His <unk> and <unk> loved him passionately , and never thought of their <unk> .
The wicked woman to whom they had given him was no sooner in her own house than she took from him the beautiful clothes in which he was enveloped , and gave them to her own son , who was the same age as Fatal ; and having <unk> the Prince in an old <unk> , she carried him into a wood where there was an immense number of wild beasts , and put him into a hole with three little lions , in order that he might be devoured .
But the mother of these lions did him no harm ; on the contrary , she <unk> him , which made him so strong , that he ran quite alone at six months .
Meanwhile the son of the nurse , whom she made pass for the Prince , died , and the King and Queen were charmed to think they had got rid of him .
Fatal remained in the wood until he was two years old ; and a nobleman of the Court , who went to hunt there , was astonished to find him in the midst of the beasts .
He took pity on him , carried him to his house , and having learnt that they sought for a child to keep Fortuné company , he presented Fatal to the Queen .
They gave a master to Fortuné to teach him to read , but they <unk> the master to make him cry .
The young Prince , who had overheard this , cried every time that he took up his <unk> that at five years old he did not know his letters , whilst Fatal read perfectly , and already knew how to write .
To <unk> the Prince , they commanded the master to whip Fatal every time that Fortuné failed in his duties .
Thus Fatal , however good he might be , did not escape being <unk> ; whilst Fortuné was so <unk> and so naughty , that he always ill-treated his brother , whom , however , he did not know to be such .
If any one gave Fatal an <unk> or a <unk> , Fortuné <unk> it out of his hands ; he made him be silent when he wished to speak ; obliged him to speak when he wished to be silent ; in a word , he was a little <unk> , on whom no one had any pity .
They lived thus till they were ten years old , and the Queen was much surprised at the ignorance of her son .
&quot; The Fairy has deceived me , &quot; said she ; &quot; I thought that my son would be the <unk> of Princes , because I wished he might succeed in all that he should desire to undertake . &quot;
She went to consult the Fairy on the subject , who said to her , &quot; Madam , you should have wished your son to have a good disposition rather than talent .
He only desires to be wicked , and he succeeds in being so , as you see . &quot;
After having said these words to the Queen , she turned her back on her .
The poor Princess , much afflicted , returned to the palace .
She would have scolded Fortuné to oblige him to do better ; but instead of promising to correct his faults , he said that if they vexed him he would <unk> himself to death .
Then the Queen , quite frightened , took him on her <unk> , kissed him , gave him <unk> , and told him that he should not study for a week if he would but eat as usual .
Meanwhile Prince Fatal became a prodigy of learning and of gentleness ; he was so accustomed to be contradicted , that he had no will of his own , and devoted himself to <unk> the fancies of Fortuné .
But that naughty child , who was enraged at seeing him more clever than himself , could not bear him , and the <unk> , in order to please the young Prince , beat Fatal every minute .
At length the wicked boy told the Queen that he would not have Fatal any longer in his sight , and that he would not eat till they had driven him from the Palace .
Thus poor Fatal was turned into the <unk> , and as they were afraid of displeasing the Prince , no one would receive him .
He passed the night under a tree dying with cold , for it was winter , and having nothing for his supper but a morsel of bread which some one had given him in charity .
The next morning he said to himself , &quot; I will not remain here doing nothing ; I will work to gain my livelihood until I shall be <unk> enough to go to the <unk> .
I remember having read in history that common soldiers have become great captains ; perhaps I may have the same good fortune if I am an honest man .
I have neither father nor mother , but God is the Father of <unk> ; He has given me a lioness for my <unk> ; He will not <unk> me . &quot;
After having said this , Fatal rose up and said his <unk> he never failed to pray to God morning and <unk> when he prayed he cast down his eyes , joined his hands , and did not look about him .
A countryman , who was passing , and saw that Fatal was <unk> with all his heart , said to himself , &quot; I am sure that must be an honest boy ; I should like to take him to keep my sheep ; God will bless me for his sake . &quot;
The countryman waited till Fatal had finished his <unk> , and then said , &quot; My little friend , will you come and keep my sheep ? --I will <unk> and take care of you . &quot;
&quot; I will , certainly , &quot; replied Fatal ; &quot; and I will do all in my power to serve you well . &quot;
This countryman was a large farmer , who had a great number of servants who robbed him very often , and his wife and children robbed him also .
When they saw Fatal , they were very well contented .
&quot; He is a child , &quot; said they ; &quot; he will do all we wish . &quot;
One day the wife said to him , &quot; My little friend , my husband is a <unk> who never gives me any money ; let me take a sheep , and you can say the wolf has carried it off . &quot;
&quot; Madam , &quot; replied Fatal , &quot; I would render you a service with all my heart , but I would much rather die than tell a story or be a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; You are a little fool , &quot; said the woman ; &quot; no one will know what you have done . &quot;
&quot; God will know it , Madam , &quot; replied Fatal ; &quot; He knows all that we do , and He will punish <unk> and those who <unk> . &quot;
When the farmer &apos;s wife heard these words , she threw herself on him , beat him , and tore out a <unk> of his hair .
Fatal cried , and the farmer hearing him , asked his wife why she beat the child ?
&quot; <unk> , &quot; said she , &quot; he is a <unk> ; I saw him this morning eat a <unk> of <unk> which I was going to take to <unk> . &quot;
&quot; <unk> !
how horrid it is to be <unk> , &quot; said the farmer ; and immediately called a servant , and bade him whip Fatal .
It was of no use the poor child saying he had not eaten the <unk> ; they believed the mistress rather than him .
After this , he went into the fields with his sheep , and the farmer &apos;s wife said to him , &quot; Well !
will you now give me a sheep ? &quot;
&quot; I should be very sorry to do so , &quot; said Fatal ; &quot; you can do what you will with me , but you cannot oblige me to tell a lie . &quot;
To revenge herself , the wicked creature then set all the other servants to treat Fatal ill .
He remained in the fields night and day ; and instead of giving the same food to him as to the other servants , she sent him nothing but bread and water , and when he returned she accused him of all the harm that was done in the house .
He passed a year with this farmer , and although he lay on the <unk> ground and was so <unk> , he became so strong that he appeared to be fifteen when he was only thirteen ; besides , he was become so <unk> , that he did not mind even when they scolded him unjustly .
One day that he was at the farm , he heard say that a neighbouring King was engaged in a great war .
He asked his master to discharge him , and went on foot into the kingdom of this Prince to become a <unk> .
He engaged himself to a Captain who was a great lord , but <unk> himself more like a common <unk> , he was so <unk> ; he swore , he beat his soldiers , he robbed them of half the money which the King gave for their food and <unk> ; and under this wicked Captain , Fatal was even more unhappy than with the farmer .
He had engaged himself for ten years , and although he saw the greater number of his <unk> desert , he would never follow their example , for he said , &quot; I have received the money to serve ten years ; I should <unk> the King if I failed in my word . &quot;
Although the Captain was a wicked man , and ill-treated Fatal like the others , he could not help <unk> him because he saw that he always did his duty .
He gave him money to do his commissions , and Fatal had the key of his chamber when he went to the country , where he <unk> with his friends .
This Captain was not fond of reading ; but he had a large library , to make believe to those who came to his house that he was a clever man , for in that country they thought that an <unk> who did not read history could never be anything but a fool and an <unk> .
When Fatal had finished his duties as a <unk> , instead of going to drink and <unk> with his <unk> , he shut himself up in the Captain &apos;s chamber and tried to learn his <unk> by reading the lives of great <unk> , and by these means he became capable of commanding an army .
He had already been seven years a <unk> when he went to the war .
His Captain took six soldiers with him , to make a search in a little wood ; and when in this little wood , the soldiers said quite low , &quot; We must kill this wicked man , who <unk> us and <unk> our bread . &quot;
Fatal told them they must not do such a wicked action ; but , instead of listening to him , they said they would kill him with the Captain , and all five drew their swords .
Fatal placed himself by the side of the Captain , and fought with so much valour that he alone killed four of the soldiers .
His Captain , seeing that he owed his life to him , begged his pardon for all the ill he had done him ; and having reported his conduct to the King , Fatal was made a Captain , and the King granted him a large <unk> .
Oh , you may be sure the soldiers did not wish to kill Fatal , for he loved them like his children ; and far from <unk> them of what belonged to them , he gave them his own money when they were wounded , and never took it away again when in an ill humour .
Meanwhile a great battle was fought , and the General commanding the army having been killed , all the officers and soldiers were retreating in disorder , but Fatal cried aloud that he would rather die sword in hand than fly like a <unk> .
His own men answered that they would not abandon him , and their good example having <unk> the others , they <unk> round Fatal and fought so well that they <unk> the enemy , and took the <unk> King &apos;s son prisoner .
The other King was very pleased when he heard that he had gained the battle , and said to Fatal that he would make him General of all the army .
He presented him to the Queen and the Princess his daughter , who gave him their hands to kiss .
When Fatal saw the Princess , he remained motionless .
She was so beautiful , that he felt <unk> in love with her , and then he was indeed miserable ; for he felt that a man like himself was not fit to marry a great Princess .
He resolved , therefore , carefully to conceal his love , and every day he suffered the greatest torment ; but it was much worse when he found that Fortuné , having seen a picture of the Princess , who was named Gracieuse , had fallen in love with her , and that he had sent ambassadors to demand her hand in marriage .
Fatal thought he should die of grief ; but the Princess Gracieuse , who knew that Fortuné was a wicked , <unk> Prince , begged the King , her father , so hard not to make her marry him , that he replied to the ambassador that the Princess did not wish to marry yet .
Fortuné , who had never been contradicted , was in a fury when he heard the reply of the Princess ; and his father , who could refuse him nothing , declared war with the father of Gracieuse , who did not distress himself much about it , for he said , &quot; So long as I have Fatal at the head of my army , I do not fear being defeated . &quot;
He sent for his General , and ordered him to prepare for war ; but Fatal , throwing himself at his feet , told him that he was born in the kingdom of the father of Fortuné , and that he could not fight against his native Sovereign .
The father of Gracieuse was in a great rage , and told Fatal that he would put him to death if he refused to obey him ; but that , on the contrary , he would give him his daughter in marriage if he gained the victory over Fortuné .
Poor Fatal , who loved Gracieuse passionately , was <unk> tempted , but in the end resolved to do his duty .
Without saying anything to the King , he quitted the Court , and abandoned all his wealth .
Meanwhile , Fortuné put himself at the head of his troops , and marched to give the King battle ; but at the end of four days he fell ill of fatigue , for he was very delicate , never having taken any exercise .
The heat , the <unk> made him ill .
However , the ambassador , who wished to make his court to Fortuné , told him that he had seen at the Court of Gracieuse the little boy who had been banished from the Palace , and that they said the father of Gracieuse had promised him his daughter .
Fortuné at this news put himself in a great passion , and as soon as he was better , set out again determined to <unk> the father of Gracieuse , and promised a large sum of money to any one who would bring Fatal to him dead or alive .
Fortuné won a great victory , although he did not fight himself , for he was afraid of being killed .
At length he <unk> the capital city of his enemy , and resolved to take it by <unk> .
The eve of this day they brought Fatal to him , bound in chains , for a great number of people had been tempted by the reward to seek for him .
Fortuné , charmed at being able to revenge himself , resolved , before commencing the <unk> , to have Fatal <unk> in sight of the enemy .
That same day he gave a great <unk> to his officers to celebrate his <unk> , being just <unk> years old .
The soldiers in the <unk> city having learnt that Fatal was taken , and that in an hour he was to be <unk> , resolved to perish or save him , for they remembered the benefits he had conferred on them whilst he was their General .
They asked permission of the King to make a <unk> , and this time they were victorious .
The gift of Fortuné had ceased , and he was killed in endeavouring to escape .
The victorious soldiers ran to take off the chains of Fatal , and at the same moment they saw two brilliant <unk> appear in the air .
The Fairy was in one of these <unk> , and the father and mother of Fatal were in the other , but asleep .
They only awoke as their chariot touched the ground , and they were very much astonished to find themselves in the midst of the army .
The Fairy then addressing the Queen , and presenting Fatal to her , said , &quot; Madam , behold in this hero your eldest son ; the misfortunes which he has undergone have corrected the defects of his character , which was violent and passionate .
Fortuné , on the contrary , who was born with good inclinations , has been entirely <unk> by <unk> , and God has not permitted him to live longer , because he would have become more wicked every day .
He has just been killed ; but to console you for his death , learn that he was on the point of <unk> his father , because he was tired of waiting to be King . &quot;
The King and Queen were very much astonished , and embraced Fatal with all their heart , of whom they had heard speak <unk> .
The Princess Gracieuse and her father learnt with joy the adventures of Fatal , who married Gracieuse , with whom he lived a long time in perfect happiness , because it was founded in virtue .

CHARLES PERRAULT .
<unk> of the Académie Française , and _ <unk> <unk> des <unk> du Roi _ , was born , as he himself tells us in the _ <unk> _ he left to his children , in Paris , on the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> ; and at eight and a half years of age was sent to the <unk> of <unk> , where he gave early proof of his <unk> <unk> .
He died in <unk> .
Although the author of many <unk> <unk> , both in prose and verse , he is indebted for his <unk> to that collection of Fairy tales which , under the title of _ Histoires , ou Contes du <unk> <unk> _ , were first published in <unk> , and speedily obtained a <unk> popularity as _ Les Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , known in England as _ Mother <unk> &apos;s Fairy Tales _ .
They were published by Perrault , under the name of his son , Perrault D <unk> , at that time a child only ten years old , whose name is appended to the dedication of the first edition to &quot; Mademoiselle , &quot; _ <unk> _ . , <unk> <unk> d <unk> , sister of <unk> , Duke of <unk> , and , after the death of Louis XIV . , <unk> of France .
Mademoiselle was born <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
The title , _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , has given rise to much <unk> , and a great deal of paper , not to say learning , has been wasted in the attempt to discover the original source of the stories , and the reason of their being called those of &quot; Ma Mère l &apos;Oye . &quot;
The former question I shall <unk> for <unk> in my <unk> of the tales themselves .
The latter we will dispose of at once .
Monsieur <unk> de Plancy , in his valuable edition of the _ <unk> <unk> de Charles Perrault _ , 8vo , Paris , 1826 ; and Baron <unk> in his _ <unk> sur les Contes des Fées <unk> à Perrault , &amp; c _ . , Paris , 12mo , same date , have pretty well exhausted the subject .
The three principal <unk> that have been insisted upon , are : -- <unk> .
That in an ancient _ <unk> _ , &quot; a goose is represented telling stories to her <unk> , worthy of them and of her . &quot;
<unk> .
That in the <unk> to the first edition of Perrault &apos;s _ Fairy Tales _ , an old woman is represented spinning , and beside her are three children , one boy and two girls , whom she is apparently amusing by her stories ; and that as <unk> this are the words _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , &#91; 47 &#93; this old woman is no less a <unk> than Ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ in <unk> <unk> _ .
<unk> .
That Ma Mère l &apos;Oye is one and the same individual with La <unk> Pédauque , the goose or <unk> Queen , a <unk> applied by some to a Bertha , Queen of France ; and by others to St. <unk> and the Queen of Saba .
The first is an assertion without proof .
The second a mere opinion , which is instantly met by <unk> , that the old woman is repeating to her <unk> the stories of Ma Mère l &apos;Oye .
The third is a <unk> proposition , and has been <unk> with accordingly .
At St. <unk> de <unk> , in the <unk> of <unk> , at St. <unk> de <unk> , at St. <unk> de <unk> , St. <unk> in <unk> , and in <unk> other <unk> in France , the statue is to be seen of a queen with a <unk> , and therefore called La <unk> <unk> <unk> , or Pédauque .
&#91; <unk> &#93; This statue is said by <unk> , but without giving any authority for his assertion , to represent St. <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> <unk> that the origin of this name is to be found at Toulouse .
He <unk> a passage in <unk> , who , speaking of certain <unk> persons , says , &quot; they were <unk> , like <unk> , or Queen Pédauque in her portrait formerly at Toulouse ; &quot; &quot; and the <unk> concludes , &quot; says Monsieur de Plancy , &quot; <unk> enough , that the Queen Pédauque is the Queen of Saba ; &quot; <unk> his opinion by the following tale in the _ <unk> of <unk> _ : -- &quot; The Queen of Saba was so fond of bathing , that she plunged every day in the sea .
When she went to visit <unk> , he received her in an apartment of crystal .
The Queen of Saba on entering it , imagined that the Monarch was in the water , and in order to pass through it to him , she <unk> her robe .
The King then seeing her feet , which were hideous , said to her : &apos; Your face <unk> all the charms of the most beautiful women , but your <unk> and feet correspond but little to it . &apos; &quot;
Even if we could suppose <unk> to have been so <unk> , there does not appear much in this <unk> story to bear upon the subject ; for what possible reason was there for <unk> these stories to the Queen of Saba ?
<unk> , _ <unk> _ of the <unk> of <unk> , goes back to the <unk> century , in France , for the source of this <unk> .
The Good King Robert had married his relative , Bertha ; <unk> <unk> compelled him to <unk> her , and imposed on him a penance of seven years .
The King , who loved Bertha , refused obedience , and the <unk> <unk> him .
He was deserted by everybody except two servants .
In the meanwhile , Bertha was said to have been brought to bed of a monster resembling an <unk> <unk> , or , according to others , a goose .
<unk> , <unk> of <unk> , brought the supposed offspring to the King , who , horrified at the sight of it , <unk> Bertha , leaving her , however , the title of Queen .
The dreadful story was circulated that she had given birth to a goose , and that she had herself become <unk> , as a punishment for her criminal marriage .
Her name of Bertha gave more authority to this story in the eyes of the people .
They remembered that Bertha or <unk> , wife of <unk> , was <unk> &quot; Bertha with the Great <unk> , &quot; because she had one foot larger than the other ; and they called the <unk> wife of Robert , &quot; Bertha au <unk> d &apos;Oie . &quot;
It is possible also , remarks Mons .
de Plancy , that this <unk> was invented to flatter Queen <unk> , who succeeded her , for it was the period of <unk> and superstition .
<unk> went to Toulouse .
She was lodged in front of an <unk> so <unk> that a man could not pass through it .
To amuse the Princess , they told her it was the bridge of Queen <unk> , or of the queen with the goose &apos;s foot .
This story was afterwards <unk> , and it became a saying that Queen Pédauque was of Toulouse .
In the _ Contes d <unk> _ , by <unk> <unk> , published during the latter half of the <unk> century , a man is made to swear by &quot; the spindle of Queen Pédauque ; &quot; and therefore <unk> <unk> that she must have been Queen Bertha , because there is an old French saying , &quot; when Queen Bertha <unk> , &quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; which is applied to any marvellous story of <unk> days , or to events that are said to have happened &quot; once upon a time . &quot;
This is very <unk> .
In the middle ages , spinning was a favourite occupation of <unk> and princesses , and Queen Bertha was by no means an exception .
&#91; 50 &#93; There is another French saying , similarly applied to an incredible <unk> &quot; It is of the time when King Robert sang to the <unk> , &quot; the said King Robert being the husband of Queen Bertha .
This is all <unk> only to our old English <unk> , &quot; When <unk> was a little boy , &quot; and &quot; When <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> , &quot; &amp; c . It is also more than probable that the Bertha of the <unk> is <unk> with the <unk> <unk> of German superstition .
She is said to live in the <unk> of the <unk> German <unk> in <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and some <unk> of <unk> and <unk> .
She appears in _ The Twelve Nights _ as a woman with <unk> hair , to inspect the <unk> , when fish and <unk> are to be eaten in honour of her , and all the <unk> must be <unk> off .
This superstition was also common in England : -- <unk> work and partly play You must on St. <unk> &apos;s day .
That is , the day after <unk> Day , and is evidently the <unk> of some <unk> <unk> in honour , most probably , of <unk> or <unk> , the Venus of the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> Bertha <unk> , &quot; is one of the characters in _ Les <unk> des <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , the <unk> composition of Jean d <unk> and three other writers , in <unk> .
It was translated into English , and printed by <unk> de <unk> , with the title of _ The <unk> of <unk> _ .
&#91; <unk> &#93; A writer who signs himself <unk> , has acutely pointed out a more probable origin of the title of _ Contes de ma _ ( or _ de le _ ) _ Mère l &apos;Oye _ , which it is clear , from <unk> in <unk> and Molière , was applied to a certain collection of old stories , long before Perrault published his _ Histoires du Temps Passé _ .
This writer <unk> us to the customs of <unk> and the <unk> of the middle ages .
He <unk> to us that the ancient <unk> confided their <unk> to the care of their <unk> .
He alludes to the two hundred thousand <unk> who , in <unk> , directed their march by the flight of a goose from Hungary to <unk> ; to the guardian fairies of the Château de <unk> in the <unk> , who , at the time of the <unk> of the <unk> , transformed themselves into wild <unk> ; to the _ <unk> _ and _ protecting _ dwarfs of the <unk> of <unk> , who are said to have been all <unk> ; and above all , to <unk> de <unk> , who , in her _ <unk> _ , calls herself <unk> ; and he concludes by saying , &quot; <unk> &apos;est que la <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> de grand <unk> <unk> <unk> la Mère l &apos;Oie ; c &apos;est que du conté le <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> une <unk> <unk> à la <unk> .... Contes de la Mère l &apos;Oie c &apos;est à <unk> contes de la <unk> grand <unk> , <unk> et <unk> <unk> l &apos;Oie <unk> <unk> l &apos;Oie , <unk> <unk> <unk> de la <unk> .... J <unk> <unk> de la <unk> . &quot;
There is , amidst all this <unk> , one fact to repose upon .
It is , that Perrault was not the <unk> of the stories he published ; that he merely <unk> to writing , no doubt with some <unk> of his own , tales of the nursery which had descended <unk> from the earliest ages of the <unk> occupation of <unk> or Bretagne , to the peculiar <unk> of which we shall find , as we proceed , they all have more or less reference , and that the particular stories printed in the first edition of his _ Histoires du Temps Passé _ , had long been <unk> known as _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ .
In <unk> , at the age of fifty , Perrault retired from his public office to <unk> himself entirely to literature and the education of his children .
Some ten years afterwards he composed a novel in verse , founded on a celebrated tale in the _ <unk> _ of <unk> , and well known to us as _ <unk> <unk> _ , his title being _ La <unk> de <unk> ; ou , la <unk> de Griselidis _ .
It was published at Paris , by Jean <unk> <unk> , in <unk> .
La <unk> had , as early as <unk> , said , in the fourth <unk> of his <unk> <unk> , _ Le <unk> des <unk> _ -- <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> moment que <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Peau d &apos;Ane m <unk> conté J &apos;y <unk> un <unk> extrême . &quot;
These lines it would seem induced Perrault to <unk> the old nursery story of _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ , with which Louis XIV . , when an infant , used to be <unk> to sleep ; and in 1694 , on the publication of the second edition of his _ Griselidis _ , he added to it his <unk> version of _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ , and _ Les Souhaits Ridicules _ , known to us as _ The <unk> <unk> _ .
The success of these stories led him to <unk> , in <unk> , his collection of _ Les Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , under the title of _ Histoires du Temps Passé _ , and in the name of his son , as before stated .
This collection consisted of eight stories only , all in prose : _ La Belle au <unk> <unk> _ , _ Le Petit <unk> Rouge _ , _ <unk> <unk> _ , _ Le Chat Botté _ , _ Les Fées _ , _ Cendrillon _ , _ Riquet à la Houpe _ , and _ Le Petit <unk> _ <unk> proof that _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ was not one of the _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oie _ , any more than _ Griselidis or Les Souhaits Ridicules _ .
The same eight stories alone appear in the second edition in <unk> ( four years after the death of Perrault ) , and in the third edition by <unk> <unk> , in <unk> .
It is not until 1742 , when an edition of the _ Histoires du Temps Passé _ was published at the <unk> , &#91; <unk> &#93; that we find any addition to the first eight stories , and then we have for the first time the story of _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse ; ou , Les <unk> de Finette _ , presented to us , with a dedication to the Countess of Murat , as a story by Perrault , although a story with that title and on that subject was published by <unk> .
Lheritier in <unk> , in a work entitled , _ <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> en <unk> et en <unk> _ , in which also appears a letter from the author to the daughter of Perrault .
But even in the <unk> edition of 1742 , there is no _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ , and it is only in <unk> modern <unk> that a prose version of that story , as well as the one in verse actually written by Perrault , is , with _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse _ , _ Griselidis _ , and _ Les Souhaits Ridicules _ , added to the eight original _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oie _ , or _ Histoires du Temps Passé _ .
From these eight stories I have selected six , <unk> only _ Le Petit <unk> Rouge _ , and _ Les Fées _ , so well known in the nursery as _ Little <unk> <unk> <unk> _ ( why &quot; <unk> ? &quot; )
and _ <unk> and <unk> _ , and for the atmosphere of which they are alone calculated .
On the others I shall now offer a few observations in their order of publication , and in the same spirit as those appended to the Fairy Tales of the Countess d &apos;Aulnoy .
BLUE BEARD .
_ La <unk> <unk> _ is founded , according to Mons .
<unk> de Plancy , on a tradition of <unk> Brittany ; and he remarks that Perrault must have heard it from the lips of nurses , or perhaps peasants , to have written with so much _ <unk> _ the scene of Sister Anne .
He states also that it is pretended that Blue Beard was actually a nobleman of the house of <unk> .
He does not , however , seem to have been aware that the original of this terrible portrait is also said to have been <unk> de <unk> , Seigneur de <unk> , created <unk> de France , <unk> <unk> , <unk> , for his defence of <unk> against the English , but whose <unk> conduct in Brittany so exasperated the public against him , that in <unk> he was arrested by order of the <unk> de Bretagne , and having been tried and found guilty , was condemned to be <unk> and <unk> , and <unk> that sentence in a field at <unk> , on the <unk> of <unk> ( some say <unk> of December ) of that same year , after <unk> , says the <unk> , great signs of repentance ; his body was taken out of the flames , and buried in the <unk> of the <unk> at <unk> .
It was , we are told , his taste for luxury and <unk> which plunged him into all the crimes for which he was so <unk> punished .
He <unk> a <unk> of two hundred thousand crowns <unk> <unk> , an enormous sum in those days , and which he had <unk> at the age of twenty .
He never travelled without being accompanied by an army of cooks , musicians , <unk> of both sexes , <unk> of <unk> , and two hundred saddle horses .
Unfortunately for him , he thought it necessary to <unk> in his suite of attendants some <unk> and pretended <unk> , which it is possible in those days may have caused the credulous <unk> to <unk> to him some <unk> of which he may have been innocent .
The whole _ <unk> _ is said to be still <unk> : but we are not furnished with any details which would <unk> him with the gentleman who rejoiced in a blue beard , and <unk> his <unk> by being run through the body with cold iron , instead of being <unk> at a stake like the guilty but <unk> <unk> .
&#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> the line of <unk> or of <unk> has the best claim to the honour of his relationship , may be still a matter of dispute ; but the fact more important to our present inquiry is , that in either case it is a tradition of Bretagne , and therefore <unk> the <unk> of Mons .
de Plancy and the Baron <unk> .
There is no fairy in this story , but there is an enchanted key .
&quot; La <unk> , &quot; says the author , &quot; <unk> <unk> . &quot;
In the old <unk> this is rendered &quot; the key was a fairy . &quot;
&quot; Fée &quot; is , however , in such <unk> as these , not a <unk> <unk> , but an <unk> , now <unk> , but to be found in <unk> , <unk> with a third e in the <unk> .
&quot; Fée , m . ; <unk> , <unk> . : <unk> appointed , destined ; also , taken , _ <unk> _ or <unk> ; also , _ charmed _ , _ <unk> _ . &quot; <unk> .
<unk> .
There is another popular passage in this story which <unk> a word of remark : -- &quot; <unk> ne <unk> <unk> que le <unk> qui <unk> et l <unk> qui <unk> . &quot;
This has been generally translated , &quot; I see nothing but the sun which makes a dust , and the grass which _ looks _ green . &quot;
Mons .
de Plancy <unk> a note to this passage , as <unk> : -- &quot; 1 .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> les <unk> .
2 .
<unk> , <unk> un <unk> <unk> . &quot;
With great submission to so high an authority , I must venture to differ with him on this point .
&quot; <unk> &quot; is an old French <unk> , <unk> to <unk> to powder .
&quot; <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , &quot; &amp; c . &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> _ <unk> _ <unk> les <unk> , &quot; J.
<unk> <unk> ; and <unk> , in his _ <unk> <unk> _ , remarks , <unk> the <unk> passage from Perrault , &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> une <unk> <unk> a <unk> . &quot;
<unk> is also a <unk> active , <unk> to <unk> or become green , and I have therefore taken the liberty to render the above celebrated reply , &quot; I see nothing but the sun making dust &quot; ( that is to say , <unk> the <unk> to dust by its heat ) , &quot; and the grass growing green . &quot;
It is the flock of sheep that afterwards raise or make _ a _ dust .
It may be thought I am &quot; making a dust , &quot; to use a familiar phrase , about a <unk> ; but I wished to point out that unless we could say in English , &quot; the sun that _ <unk> _ and the grass that _ <unk> _ , &quot; we cannot approach the <unk> and <unk> description of dear Sister Anne .
Mons .
de Plancy <unk> that the incidents of this story ( <unk> , of course , that of the enchanted key ) are not impossible , provided they are supposed to have occurred in the middle ages ; but that Perrault has placed them nearer his own times , by saying that Blue Beard &apos;s widow employed part of her fortune in <unk> commissions for her two brothers , as the <unk> of commissions in the French army was not known before the reign of <unk> I. ; but he does not notice that the mention of <unk> and <unk> <unk> them still nearer .
Blue Beard has been a favourite subject with the <unk> , both French and English .
The celebrated <unk> by <unk> <unk> the younger , produced at <unk> <unk> <unk> , in <unk> , in which the scene was <unk> to the <unk> , was rendered still more popular by the music of <unk> <unk> : the &quot; <unk> in Blue Beard &quot; was <unk> on every <unk> alternately with the &quot; Duke of <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; the &quot; <unk> of <unk> , &quot; and the &quot; <unk> to <unk> . &quot;
THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOOD .
The charming fairy tale of _ La Belle au <unk> <unk> _ is the gem of the collection .
Its popularity is as great at the present day as it was two hundred years ago .
I have called the reader &apos;s attention in a <unk> note to the first mention probably of seven league boots , &#91; <unk> &#93; but I reserved for the Appendix some observations upon the earliest mention of Ogres and <unk> .
The Baron <unk> , in his letters already <unk> , has , I think <unk> , <unk> the earlier notion that the word Ogre was derived from a <unk> source .
He <unk> it from the <unk> or <unk> , a <unk> race mentioned by <unk> in the sixth century .
Some <unk> of Oigurs established themselves in the <unk> , and their language was called &quot; <unk> _ <unk> _ &quot; by the Italian <unk> who first <unk> with them .
In the <unk> and <unk> centuries all <unk> were <unk> under the name of Oigurs .
When the <unk> , a <unk> <unk> from the banks of the <unk> , <unk> <unk> and <unk> , the names of the ancient <unk> and of the ferocious Oigurs were united to <unk> them .
They were first called <unk> , and their country <unk> , from whence <unk> and Hungary .
The <unk> committed by and attributed to the Oigurs spread horror and alarm throughout Europe .
Their cruelties to <unk> , in which they have been only equalled by the barbarous <unk> in the <unk> <unk> events in <unk> , took <unk> hold of the <unk> of those to whose care children were specially entrusted , and the <unk> of <unk> or Ogre became <unk> with that of <unk> , or any other ferocious monster in human form .
In <unk> &apos;s _ <unk> de la <unk> <unk> _ , Ogre is also derived from the same source .
That &quot; l <unk> &quot; of the Italians , the <unk> of <unk> and <unk> , may be derived from the <unk> <unk> , according to <unk> , as Mr. Keightley <unk> , I am not prepared to dispute .
Such curious <unk> are common to all who have wandered in the <unk> of <unk> ; but I will merely <unk> that it is quite as probable that <unk> and <unk> were also derived from <unk> , the name by which the <unk> of the <unk> were known to the Italians as early as the <unk> century , as we have already seen .
<unk> , however ( <unk> ) , says , &quot; <unk> as <unk> , a _ sea _ monster , &quot; which the Ogre never was .
<unk> with the distaff is the oldest form .
A <unk> appears in <unk> of the fourteenth century , but the woman <unk> stood to her work .
The more modern <unk> , at which women sit , was invented in <unk> , by a <unk> of <unk> , named <unk> .
For illustration of the accident to the Princess , it is perhaps worthy of remark that in the <unk> and <unk> provinces of France the spindle is sometimes pointed with iron .
&quot; It is thus , &quot; says Mr. <unk> ( the author of a paper on the <unk> in the _ <unk> _ , vol .
<unk> .
) , &quot; rendered a <unk> , with which the woman could defend herself . &quot;
The same <unk> <unk> us that &quot; the art of spinning in its <unk> and most <unk> forms is yet pursued in <unk> , where the women of <unk> still <unk> the spindle <unk> by that &apos; _ ancient rustic law which forbade its use without doors _ . &apos; &quot;
So that the father of the <unk> Beauty had a sort of <unk> for his &quot; <unk> not spin with <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> have a version of this story called _ <unk> _ : <unk> <unk> &apos;s _ <unk> <unk> <unk> . _ MASTER CAT ; OR PUSS IN BOOTS .
_ Maître Chat ; ou , le Chat Botté . _ <unk> capital story is said by Mr. Dunlop and Mr. Keightley to be taken from a collection of stories by <unk> <unk> Straparola , printed at <unk> in <unk> , under the titles of _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ , and translated into French &quot; with considerable <unk> &quot; in <unk> .
That the first story of the <unk> Night is derived from the same source as Perrault &apos;s there can be little doubt ; but I am not by any means prepared to admit that Perrault was indebted to that or any other printed collection for this or any one of those eight stories which it is clear were well known in France as _ Les Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ .
Straparola , who seems to have <unk> <unk> from <unk> , and <unk> stories wherever he could find them , drew upon the <unk> of Brittany as well as on the <unk> of <unk> .
It is indeed notorious that the Italian <unk> were indebted almost entirely to the <unk> or <unk> of <unk> , whilst they themselves admit that the plots of their romances were of <unk> origin .
In <unk> of old time These <unk> were <unk> , so <unk> this <unk> .
<unk> the old <unk> of the _ <unk> le <unk> _ , the author of which Mr. Dunlop <unk> &quot; must have been better informed than any modern writer &quot; ( _ History of <unk> _ , 8vo , <unk> , p . <unk> ) .
In the second edition of the Countess D &apos;Aulnoy &apos;s _ Fairy Tales _ , I took an opportunity of <unk> that lady from the charge so hastily preferred against her both by Mr. Dunlop and Mr. Keightley , and I now <unk> as strongly the <unk> of the <unk> of the same writers respecting the tales of Charles Perrault .
Neither in the story of Straparola , first of the <unk> Night , nor in the _ <unk> _ of <unk> <unk> ( whose _ Pentamerone _ , published in <unk> , is also <unk> asserted to have been the &quot; origin &quot; of the French _ Contes des Fées _ &#91; <unk> &#93; ) , do we find _ <unk> in <unk> _ .
What would _ Le Maître Chat _ be , were he not also _ Le Chat Botté _ ?
Nor is there an <unk> <unk> <unk> of a legend of <unk> consequently the delicious scene between him and <unk> , which so <unk> <unk> up the French story .
The same <unk> indications of its being a veritable _ <unk> du Temps Passé _ , <unk> against the belief alluded to by <unk> de Plancy , that the Marquis de Carabas was intended as a portrait of some particular nobleman of the time of Louis XIV .
; and therefore that the <unk> of the castle and property of the <unk> might be an allusion to the <unk> <unk> by D <unk> of the <unk> of a <unk> , an <unk> in consequence of the <unk> persecutions at the close of the seventeenth century , &quot; In which case , &quot; he <unk> , &quot; the Cat would be Madame de Maintenon ! &quot;
What a pity so ingenious an idea should be <unk> of foundation .
It is more probable that the wits of the day compared the illustrious <unk> to the Marquis de Carabas and his Cat .
I have kept the old English title of _ <unk> in <unk> _ , though it is not <unk> that of the original .
It would have been an <unk> offence to have altered it .
The tricks of the cat to catch the rats are described almost in the words of <unk> , in his <unk> of _ Le Chat et le <unk> <unk> _ , in which Maître <unk> , &quot; l <unk> des <unk> , &quot; a second <unk> , &quot; se <unk> la <unk> en <unk> &quot; and &quot; s <unk> &quot; for the same purpose .

&#91; <unk> &#93; Mr. Dunlop , who alludes to this story , speaks of the murder of his wives .
The author of _ L <unk> de <unk> des <unk> _ , gives him but one wife , <unk> de <unk> , daughter and heiress of <unk> de <unk> , Seigneur de <unk> et <unk> , whom he married December <unk> , <unk> , and who <unk> him , and was <unk> to Jean de <unk> , <unk> d <unk> .

&#91; <unk> &#93; In the <unk> note I have mentioned _ Jack and the <unk> _ .
This is an error .
There are no seven league boots in that story .
It is _ Jack the <unk> <unk> _ only who is the fortunate <unk> of the &quot; <unk> of <unk> , &quot; which either suggested , or were suggested by , the boots aforesaid .
&#91; <unk> &#93; &quot; Of the _ ten _ stories in the _ Mother <unk> &apos;s Fairy Tales _ of Perrault , _ seven _ are to be found in the _ Pentamerone _ , &quot; says Mr. Keightley , in his _ Tales and <unk> _ , p . <unk> .
I have already shown that there were only eight stories in the _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , and in the _ Pentamerone _ I find but two that have any <unk> to the tales of <unk> . , _ <unk> _ and _ La <unk> <unk> _ , both <unk> <unk> in many points from the ancient Breton <unk> .
CINDERELLA ; OR THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER .
_ Cendrillon ; ou , la <unk> <unk> de <unk> _ .
Here , again , could it enter the heart of an Englishman to call this anything but _ Cinderella _ ?
I am proud to say I was not equal to such a sacrifice to <unk> .
I should have been afraid to meet the eyes of my <unk> .
There are persons , however , who have been cruel enough to <unk> with the second title , to destroy &quot; the little glass slipper , &quot; and tell us that in the original story it was not a <unk> &quot; de _ <unk> _ , &quot; but &quot; de _ <unk> _ &quot; -- _ i.e. _ , a <unk> much worn in the middle ages , and from which the charge of <unk> in <unk> was taken .
I thank the stars that I have not been able to discover any foundation for this alarming report .
Even should it be unfortunately the fact , it would not affect the _ Conte de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , as handed down to us by Perrault .
In that , it is an <unk> &quot; <unk> de _ <unk> _ , &quot; and has been said to represent <unk> the extreme <unk> of woman &apos;s reputation , and the prudence of flight before it is _ too late _ .
There appears to be no doubt that this story is founded on an old <unk> tradition , as in 1826 an alteration of an ancient Breton <unk> was published by Madame <unk> , entitled _ <unk> de <unk> ; ou , la <unk> Cendrillon _ , which is taken from the same source , but <unk> of its fairy <unk> ; and the Countess d &apos;Aulnoy had previously <unk> herself of some portions of the tale of _ Cendrillon _ in her story of _ Finette <unk> _ .
The trial of the slipper is like that of the ring in the story of _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ , and a &quot; little glass <unk> &quot; is the subject of a German fairy tale .
The <unk> have also a version of _ Cinderella _ , in which the slipper is of &quot; pure gold . &quot;
At the banquet it will be remembered that the Prince is said to have given Cinderella both oranges and citrons .
These do not appear to us at present as particularly <unk> of the magnificence of a royal collation ; but in the seventeenth century , <unk> oranges were considered a present worthy princes of the blood .
&quot; Monsieur , me <unk> <unk> , &quot; says the <unk> de <unk> , in her _ <unk> _ , &quot; <unk> me <unk> des oranges de <unk> . &quot;
Molière , in his description of the comedy which formed a portion of the famous fêtes given at <unk> , in <unk> , by Louis XIV . , tells us that &quot; d <unk> on <unk> sur le <unk> une <unk> <unk> d <unk> de <unk> ; &quot; and in his own comedy , _ L <unk> _ , when <unk> <unk> to his mistress for not having prepared a collation for her , his son <unk> , &quot; J &apos;y <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , et <unk> &apos;ai <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> _ d <unk> de la <unk> , de citrons <unk> _ , et de <unk> . &quot;
<unk> , according to L <unk> ( _ <unk> des <unk> _ , <unk> ) , the <unk> was supposed to give a better colour to the lips , and the ladies of the Court in the <unk> century , therefore , &quot; <unk> en <unk> _ des citrons <unk> _ , <unk> <unk> de <unk> en <unk> pour <unk> les livres <unk> . &quot;

RIQUET WITH THE TUFT .
_ Riquet à la Houpe _ is perhaps the least known of the eight _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ ; but although it has not the attractive qualities which have occasioned the popularity of the others , it is an excellent story , with a valuable moral , though , <unk> enough , the _ <unk> _ with which it concludes takes no notice of it .
The object of the story is evidently to show the superiority of mental to personal <unk> , and the power of the former not only to compensate for ugliness and deformity , but even to make one forget them .
The concluding verses , however , point only to the fact that love can embellish its object , and turn even defects into beauties , passing over the more important one of the cause of the love itself .
Some writers have fancied the hero of this story to have been a person of distinction at the Court of Louis XIV . , forgetting that , like the rest in the collection , it is a &quot; <unk> du <unk> <unk> . &quot;
But , as Monsieur de Plancy remarks , &quot; On <unk> <unk> des <unk> ou <unk> <unk> &apos;y en a point ; &quot; and , as in the case of _ Le Chat Botté _ , the <unk> may have been made to the man from the story .
The reader has been <unk> to this Appendix by a <unk> note at page <unk> , respecting the _ <unk> de <unk> _ .
The explanation offered by the <unk> of the French edition of 1826 is , that &quot; les <unk> <unk> se <unk> dans leur <unk> de <unk> de la <unk> de <unk> &apos; animal , <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> la queue ; &quot; and he <unk> , &quot; on <unk> <unk> , dans <unk> provinces , des _ <unk> _ <unk> <unk> . &quot;
That a <unk> should sport a <unk> &apos;s <unk> , or wear a cap made of the <unk> of any animal , is not in the least remarkable or <unk> ; but I do not see how it can be taken as a fact in support of the assertion that cooks did so either in the time of Louis XIV .
or at present ; and the <unk> does not give us any authority for that assertion .
Of all animals , a <unk> would be the last I should imagine a French cook would select to furnish him with a <unk> or a sign of company , and that &quot; twenty or thirty <unk> &quot; should _ all _ have &quot; _ la _ <unk> à la <unk> et _ la _ queue de renard _ sur l <unk> _ , &quot; appears to me , if we are to consider the author to have meant actually the tail of a <unk> , a very remarkable circumstance , as the use of the <unk> <unk> in both cases <unk> the &quot; queue de renard &quot; must have been as much the mark of a cook as the &quot; <unk> , &quot; or larding-pin .
I confess I am not satisfied with this explanation ; and all my own <unk> and those kindly made for me by friends both in Paris and London , have hitherto failed in throwing any light upon this curious passage .
&quot; <unk> de <unk> &quot; is the name of a plant known by us as <unk> , and it is also applied to a particular family of flowers ; but it is likewise the name of an <unk> .
&quot; <unk> a <unk> <unk> ou <unk> par le <unk> <unk> on se _ <unk> pour <unk> _ . &quot; <unk> .
This description looks <unk> like some <unk> to the larding-pin .
The same authority has also : &quot; <unk> de renard à <unk> .
Le queue de <unk> animal <unk> se <unk> les <unk> pour <unk> les <unk> d <unk> ou d <unk> . &quot;
This , as we know , is not the entire <unk> , but a portion of the hair .
In <unk> of any positive information , I will merely make three <unk> : 1 .
A portion of the <unk> <unk> , dried , which might be used as a <unk> .
2 .
A small instrument for piercing or <unk> .
3 .
A portion of the <unk> , as used by <unk> of wood or metal , and probably by the _ <unk> _ of that day , as we find it was <unk> to <unk> the <unk> and <unk> of the game and poultry served up at the royal <unk> .
<unk> , amongst other writers , tells us of a grand banquet in which &quot; le <unk> service <unk> d <unk> <unk> <unk> que <unk> , et _ <unk> le service <unk> <unk> _ . &quot;
In the <unk> of <unk> there is a receipt for making &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; ( royal ) , in which the cook is told , after he has dressed it in &quot; <unk> plate , &quot; to &quot; take _ a <unk> of <unk> <unk> _ and another of _ silver <unk> _ , and lay <unk> ( them ) on , <unk> <unk> &apos;s cross <unk> , above the <unk> , and then take <unk> plate , or <unk> plate , or <unk> <unk> , and <unk> <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> <unk> in the <unk> places between the <unk> , and serve <unk> <unk> . &quot;
The <unk> served in his &quot; <unk> , &quot; -- _ i.e. _ , neck feathers , or in his &quot; pride &quot; -- _ i.e. _ with tail displayed , &amp; <unk> always his <unk> gilt .
Whatever , in fine , the &quot; queue de renard &quot; may have been , I cannot doubt that , worn &quot; sur l <unk> , &quot; it was a <unk> mark of a _ <unk> _ of that day , as a pen behind the ear has been of a <unk> in <unk> ; and the <unk> is in favour of the third <unk> , as _ <unk> _ were , as their name <unk> , those cooks who prepared the <unk> <unk> only , and in all the old <unk> it is especially the &quot; <unk> &quot; that is &quot; <unk> . &quot;
_ Riquet à la Houpe _ is supposed to have inspired Madame de Villeneuve with the idea of the _ Beauty and the Beast _ .
In my notice of that story , I shall have a word to say in <unk> of that <unk> .
_ Riquet with the Tuft _ was the first of those fairy <unk> which the public have so kindly received during twenty years , at the <unk> , <unk> <unk> , <unk> <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> .
It was written in <unk> with Mr. Charles <unk> , and produced at the <unk> under Madame <unk> &apos;s <unk> , December <unk> , <unk> .
LITTLE THUMBLING .
_ Le Petit <unk> . _ <unk> story , under the titles of _ <unk> <unk> &apos; my <unk> _ , _ Little <unk> and his <unk> _ , &amp; c . , has been continually <unk> amongst our English nursery tales ; and as I have already spoken of <unk> and <unk> boots , there is little else in it that calls for observation .
The latter are said to have been &quot; <unk> &quot; -- _ i.e. _ enchanted , as the key in _ Blue Beard _ .
The attempt of the parents to lose the children in the wood is an incident in Madame d &apos;Aulnoy &apos;s story of _ Finette <unk> _ , drawn , no doubt , from the same source , as <unk> , in his _ <unk> au <unk> _ , bears witness to _ Le Petit <unk> _ having been an &quot; <unk> conté <unk> , &quot; which has for ages amused &quot; les <unk> de la <unk> Bretagne . &quot;
I think it is quite unnecessary for me to go into the question of this story being founded on an <unk> in <unk> &apos;s _ <unk> _ , to prove that Perrault was not thinking of Ulysses in the <unk> of <unk> , or that the pebbles and bread were not suggested by the clue of <unk> .
In <unk> &apos;s _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ are several stories about Thumbling ; and I need scarcely remind the reader that England has her own renowned _ <unk> <unk> _ .
THE <unk> DE <unk> .
<unk> <unk> DE <unk> , daughter of <unk> , second Marquis de <unk> , <unk> of <unk> , and <unk> by the mother &apos;s side , to the Count d <unk> , <unk> of France , was born at <unk> in <unk> .
At the age of sixteen , she came to Paris in the <unk> worn by the peasants in Brittany , the language of which province she spoke very <unk> .
Her appearance in this dress caused such a sensation that the Queen desired her to wear it on her <unk> at Court .
She married <unk> , Count de Murat , <unk> of <unk> and <unk> des <unk> du Roi , descended from a family established in <unk> before <unk> , and that afterwards passed into <unk> .
<unk> suspected by Madame de Maintenon of having been part author of a <unk> in which all the persons <unk> the Court of Louis XIV . , in 1694 , were <unk> or <unk> , she was banished to <unk> , <unk> du <unk> .
After the death of Louis XIV . , the <unk> Duke of <unk> , at the request of Madame de <unk> , recalled Madame de Murat in <unk> .
She did not , however , long enjoy her return to Paris , as she died at her Château de la <unk> in <unk> the following year ( <unk> ) , at the early age of <unk> .
She was the author of many works , both in prose and verse , &#91; <unk> &#93; but is best known by her _ Contes des Fées _ , six of the most popular of which are here translated .
Four of these ( _ Le Parfait <unk> _ , _ Anguillette _ , _ <unk> et Belle _ , and _ Le Palais de la <unk> _ ) were printed in <unk> , and again in <unk> , in the collection of Fairy Tales attributed to the Countess d &apos;Aulnoy , of whom Madame de Murat was the <unk> , but certainly not the rival .
Her stories have more the character of romances and <unk> than fairy tales , with a strong <unk> of sentiment , such as is to be found in the <unk> of Madame de <unk> , <unk> .
de La <unk> , the Countess d <unk> , and others of that period .
The plots of them were most probably taken from &quot; Les contes <unk> <unk> <unk> d <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> les <unk> . &quot;
For to this she is specially invited in the verses at the end of the prose story of _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse _ , which is dedicated to her , and attributed to Perrault .
It has been shown , however , that if that version of _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse _ were really written by him , it was not published till 1742 , <unk> years after the death of the <unk> author , and <unk> after the death of the lady to whom it is dedicated .
PERFECT LOVE .
_ Le Parfait <unk> _ is a story <unk> considerable talent , although deficient in those lively <unk> , those amusing <unk> and <unk> to the manners and dresses of the period which give so much <unk> to the Fairy Tales of Perrault , and the more <unk> <unk> of Madame d &apos;Aulnoy .
The interest is entirely of a serious character ; but the magic ring , with its power over the four <unk> value of which is destroyed by the too hasty wish of the <unk> an ingenious and <unk> idea , and the fatal lamps a truly affecting situation .
This is the first Fairy <unk> that gives us a picture of the Gnomes , and their <unk> <unk> superstition existing all over Europe ; the <unk> , or <unk> men of the <unk> ; the little people and ground <unk> of <unk> ; and the <unk> or <unk> of Brittany .
&quot; The wise And prudent little people , who keep warm By their fine <unk> , many a <unk> down <unk> the <unk> <unk> .
<unk> native gold , And the rock <unk> , <unk> like towers , clear , <unk> , <unk> with colours <unk> Through the fair palace ; and the little folks , So happy and so <unk> , amuse themselves Sometimes with singing .
&quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; And accordingly we find them singing the charms of Irolite , and entertaining the lovers with &quot; une <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> un <unk> <unk> . &quot;
FOOTNOTES : &#91; <unk> &#93; Her _ Histoires <unk> et <unk> _ has been attributed by the <unk> <unk> du <unk> to the Countess d &apos;Aulnoy .
&#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> &amp; c . , <unk> J. R. <unk> , translated by Mr. Keightley ( _ Fairy <unk> . _ ) ANGUILLETTE .
_ Anguillette _ is a story of the same character as _ Le Parfait <unk> _ .
The interest is <unk> serious , and the termination <unk> , <unk> one , by the transformation of the victims into trees , of the <unk> of the _ <unk> <unk> _ of Madame d &apos;Aulnoy .
The inconstancy of Atimir is very naturally drawn ; and there is considerable merit in the general conduct of the story .
YOUNG AND HANDSOME .
_ <unk> et Belle _ might almost be placed amongst the pastoral romances of D <unk> and <unk> de <unk> .
It is full of <unk> <unk> , many of them suggested , probably , to the writer as to the <unk> by the <unk> <unk> so much in <unk> during the seventeenth and <unk> centuries at the Court of <unk> .
The sudden and unexpected introduction of Zephyr at the very close of the story as the <unk> <unk> <unk> , is quite in accordance with the taste of the period , though much out of place in a fairy tale .
It is not , however , for me to find fault with it , as it afforded me a hint for a character which enabled Mr. <unk> to display the <unk> of his <unk> in the last of that long <unk> of <unk> I have already alluded to .
In the &quot; <unk> &quot; above mentioned , this tale was <unk> for Madame d &apos;Aulnoy &apos;s _ <unk> <unk> _ , the _ <unk> _ of which is also produced by the <unk> introduction of <unk> personages .
THE PALACE OF <unk> .
_ Le Palais de la <unk> _ was printed in the &quot; <unk> &quot; as Madame d &apos;Aulnoy &apos;s , under the title of the _ Palace of <unk> _ .
It is <unk> remarkable for its <unk> <unk> very original one for a fairy tale , as the lovers are married , and do not &quot; live happy ever afterwards . &quot;
THE PRINCE OF LEAVES .
_ Le Prince des <unk> _ is , to the best of my knowledge , presented for the first time in an English <unk> .
It is more of a fairy tale than the four preceding it , and appears to me to have been suggested to Madame de Murat by her residence at <unk> , where , indeed , it is most likely to have been written .
The natural history of the turquoise had been <unk> <unk> by the <unk> of <unk> and other Oriental <unk> ; and more particularly by that of a book by <unk> de <unk> , _ Le Parfait <unk> _ ; <unk> , <unk> .
The turquoise &quot; de la <unk> Roche , &quot; that Madame de Murat speaks of , is a stone found near <unk> and <unk> , in <unk> true Oriental turquoise ; whilst those called &quot; de la <unk> Roche , &quot; are not stones , but <unk> <unk> , and are found in Europe , particularly in France , at <unk> , ( the very place to which Madame de Murat was <unk> ; ) and near <unk> , in the <unk> du <unk> ; and in the <unk> , according to the account of <unk> in the _ <unk> de l <unk> _ , <unk> .
<unk> were formerly very highly <unk> , and all kinds of virtues and <unk> attributed to them , the greater part of which are fabulous , although <unk> <unk> by de <unk> , who was <unk> to <unk> <unk> . , <unk> of <unk> .
The <unk> , even in his day , took great pains to distinguish between those that retained their colour and those that turned green .
A fine <unk> turquoise , the size of a <unk> , sold in that day for two hundred <unk> and upwards .
&quot; The turquoise possesses such attractions , &quot; says de <unk> , &quot; that men do not think their hands are well adorned , nor their magnificence sufficiently displayed , if they are not <unk> with some of the finest . &quot;
The name is supposed to have been derived from <unk> , the country from which they were probably first <unk> ; but others <unk> it from <unk> , a name given by Italians to a particular blue .
Even at this day , the <unk> or loss of a turquoise is considered a <unk> of evil .
THE FORTUNATE PUNISHMENT .
_ L <unk> <unk> _ is also , I believe , new to the English reader .
It is an exceedingly graceful story , and the _ <unk> _ is novel as well as ingenious .
The &quot; little animal &quot; into which the unfortunate Naimée is transformed , is not specified by the author , but from an allusion to its _ <unk> de <unk> _ , I suppose it to be a crayfish , a favourite with the writers of fairy tales .
MADEMOISELLE DE <unk> <unk> .
<unk> <unk> DE <unk> <unk> was the daughter of <unk> de <unk> , Marquis de <unk> , and <unk> of <unk> de <unk> , <unk> de la <unk> , whose escape from the <unk> of St. <unk> is celebrated in the _ <unk> _ of <unk> , and who afterwards greatly <unk> himself by his <unk> during the reign of <unk> <unk> .
and Louis <unk> .
She was born in the Castle of <unk> , near <unk> , in <unk> , about <unk> , and died in Paris in <unk> .
Her mother , <unk> de <unk> , was <unk> de <unk> , and daughter of the Baron de <unk> .
Mademoiselle de la <unk> would therefore appear to be <unk> connected with Madame de Murat .
She is said to have been married , in <unk> , to Charles de <unk> ; but that the marriage was declared <unk> and <unk> ten days afterwards .
She was the author of several <unk> and romances , and of an <unk> , in verse , to Madame de Maintenon ; but is best known by her fairy tales , _ Contes des Contes _ , though only one of them has , to my knowledge , appeared previously in English .
That one <unk> FAIRER THAN A FAIRY .
_ Plus Belle que Fée _ was published , with the usual <unk> and <unk> , about twenty years ago , in a collection of nursery tales .
The story bears a strong resemblance to the _ Gracieuse and <unk> _ of the Countess d &apos;Aulnoy ; and though the plot is rendered more <unk> by the addition of another pair of lovers , it does not gain in interest as much as it <unk> in <unk> and simplicity .
The fair author has , however , appended a note to her story called _ L <unk> _ , which <unk> us to suppose that she was indebted to any previous writer for the plot of her story .
She <unk> &quot; This story ( _ L <unk> _ ) is taken from an ancient romance ( &apos; <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos; ) named _ <unk> _ , several things being <unk> which were not in accordance with our modern <unk> , and several others added .
Some names are changed .
It is the only story that is not entirely the composition of the author .
_ All the others are purely of her <unk> . _ &quot; After this positive declaration , which we have no right to question , why should we refuse to give credit to the Countess d &apos;Aulnoy for the possession of equal powers of imagination ?
I am by no means <unk> the <unk> of _ Plus Belle que Fée _ , in pointing out that the notion of the _ Fair of Time _ seems to have been suggested by an old fairy legend of <unk> .
&quot; Near the village of <unk> , half a league to the <unk> of <unk> , there is a high <unk> , surrounded on all sides by high <unk> , except that over the sea , where the <unk> render it <unk> .
It is named &apos; La <unk> de <unk> , &apos; or &apos; Le <unk> de <unk> , &apos; or simply &apos; Le <unk> &apos; or &apos; <unk> . &apos;
<unk> tells that _ the Fées used to hold a fair there , at which all sorts of magic <unk> from their secret <unk> were offered for <unk> _ , and the most <unk> entreaties and <unk> were employed to induce those who frequented it to become <unk> ; but the moment any one did so , and stretched forth his hand to take the <unk> he had selected , the perfidious Fées seized him , and <unk> him down the <unk> .
&quot; &#91; <unk> &#93; I cannot say that Mademoiselle de la <unk> has made the most of this tradition , supposing her to have been acquainted with it .
Her allusion to the entertainments at <unk> , to which alone she says this fair was to be compared , has reference , I think , to a &quot; <unk> Fair , &quot; as we should now call it , in which the <unk> were attended , as in our days , by the principal personages of the Court .
I feel satisfied that I have <unk> seen an account of that entertainment , but unfortunately have no note which would enable me to turn to the authority .
FOOTNOTES : &#91; <unk> &#93; Keightley &apos;s _ Fairy <unk> _ , 12mo , <unk> , p . <unk> .
There was also a piece , called _ La <unk> des Fées _ , written by Le <unk> , and acted at the <unk> St. Germain .
THE GOOD WOMAN .
_ La <unk> <unk> _ is far superior to _ Plus Belle que Fée _ .
It is indeed worthy of Madame d &apos;Aulnoy , and I cannot account for its never having previously met with a <unk> .
It will be recognised by <unk> as the foundation of my Fairy <unk> , _ The Good Woman in the Wood _ , in which form the <unk> incidents of this charming story were first introduced to a London public .
As we are bound , after the author &apos;s declaration , to consider it an original story , we need not trouble ourselves to hunt after its source .
The other original fairy <unk> _ <unk> _ , _ <unk> _ , _ <unk> et Blue _ , _ Le <unk> des <unk> _ , and _ La <unk> d <unk> _ <unk> no comparison to the two I have selected .
MADAME DE <unk> .
<unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; daughter of a gentleman of <unk> , &quot; and widow of Monsieur de <unk> , Seigneur de Villeneuve , <unk> of <unk> , died at Paris , in the house of <unk> , the <unk> writer , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
Such is the sum of the information afforded us by <unk> and <unk> , concerning the author of one of the most popular fairy tales ever written .
THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST .
_ La Belle et la <unk> . _ <unk> of English readers have no doubt been all their lives under the impression that they knew nearly by heart the story of _ Beauty and the Beast _ ; and though few , alas !
may have taken the trouble to inquire who was the author of it , those who have , imagine themselves indebted for it to Madame Leprince de Beaumont .
<unk> , there are many , no doubt , in France who are under the same belief , for &quot; _ La Belle et la <unk> _ , par Madame Leprince de Beaumont , &quot; is , without a word of explanation , at this moment <unk> as a portion of the French <unk> <unk> , and was published , with various other stories , in a small edition of _ Contes des Fées _ only last year , under her name , by a <unk> on the <unk> des <unk> , Paris .
It is only those who have read the original story by Madame de Villeneuve , either in the _ Contes <unk> _ , &#91; <unk> &#93; or in the _ Cabinet des Fées _ , who will not be surprised to find that Madame de Beaumont has merely the merit of having cut this admirable work down to the smallest <unk> <unk> , and made a pretty little nursery tale of one of the most ingeniously constructed stories in the whole <unk> of fairy <unk> .
The story of the Beast is but alluded to in a few words , and that of the real parents of Beauty altogether <unk> .
It is no answer to say that the version by Madame de Beaumont is an agreeable story , that the moral is preserved , and that there are portions of the original tale which required alteration or <unk> .
In justice to Madame de Villeneuve , it ought never to be printed without the acknowledgment that it is simply an <unk> of her composition , adapted to the use of <unk> readers , by Madame de Beaumont .
I have <unk> a dozen lines , and softened one <unk> expression ; but , with the exception of this very slight and indispensable alteration , Madame de Villeneuve &apos;s story is now placed before the English public in its <unk> .
It was published in <unk> , and Mr. Dunlop remarks that &quot; it surpasses all that has been produced by the lively and <unk> <unk> of France or <unk> ; &quot; but in his notice of the tales of Perrault , he says that it is an <unk> of and <unk> from _ Riquet à la Houpe _ .
I think this is one of those hasty <unk> of which we are all occasionally guilty .
I cannot , for my part , see any resemblance between the two stories .
In _ Riquet _ , an ugly and <unk> prince <unk> the hand of a lovely <unk> usual triumph of mind over matter ; but in _ Beauty and the Beast _ , the <unk> is not merely a <unk> man , but a monster of the most horrible and <unk> description , and who is specially <unk> from <unk> himself of those mental powers which might in the slightest degree affect the judgment of the lady .
<unk> and gratitude are the motives which influence Beauty to sacrifice her own happiness to ensure that of the Beast .
In the other case , admiration of the talent of Riquet renders the Princess gradually blind to the defects of his person .
_ Le <unk> _ of Madame d &apos;Aulnoy offers infinitely more points of resemblance .
The transformation of the King into a <unk> by a jealous and vindictive fairy , and the permission given by him to <unk> to visit her family , on her solemnly promising to return by a stated period , are features too obvious to be overlooked .
The despair of the <unk> in consequence of her not <unk> her promise on the last occasion , is also like that of the Monster ; but Madame de Villeneuve has <unk> the <unk> <unk> ; and notwithstanding the <unk> I have pointed out , _ Beauty and the Beast _ , taken as a whole , deserves all the praise that those who are best acquainted with it have <unk> accorded to it .
It is a curious circumstance that the _ <unk> <unk> _ of <unk> , and the German version of _ Cinderella _ , both commence with the departure of the father on a journey , and the requests of his daughters <unk> exactly in their general character with those in _ Beauty and the Beast _ , while we find nothing of the sort in Perrault &apos;s _ Cendrillon _ .
I <unk> from this that the Italian and German writers have mixed two old stories together , and that Madame de Villeneuve &apos;s is founded on one of them .

THE <unk> DE <unk> .
<unk> <unk> DE <unk> , DE <unk> , DE <unk> , DE <unk> , <unk> DE <unk> , was born in Paris , in <unk> , and died the <unk> of <unk> , <unk> .
He entered the French army early , and distinguished himself in <unk> and at the <unk> of <unk> .
After the <unk> of <unk> he visited <unk> , and in <unk> went to the <unk> in the suite of the <unk> of France to the <unk> <unk> .
During this journey he undertook an adventure which proves his courage as well as his love of art .
On arriving at <unk> , he was anxious to profit by the necessary delay of a few days to visit the ruins of <unk> , which are about twelve hours &apos; journey from that place .
The neighbourhood was at that time <unk> by a band of <unk> , the <unk> of which was the notorious and terrible Caracayoli .
The roads were exceedingly <unk> for <unk> ; but the Count de <unk> was not to be daunted .
He provided himself with a dress made simply of <unk> , and carrying nothing about him that could <unk> the most <unk> <unk> , he sought out two of the band of Caracayoli , and <unk> with them for a safe conduct from <unk> to <unk> and back again , the money to be paid only on his return .
It being their interest to take care of him , he found them the most faithful <unk> in the world .
Caracayoli , on learning the object of his journey , <unk> offered to assist his <unk> .
He informed the Count that in the neighbourhood of his retreat there were some ruins well worthy his inspection , and to <unk> his visit to them , he mounted him and one of his <unk> on two fine <unk> horses .
The ruins proved to be those of <unk> .
The Count returned to the retreat of Caracayoli , and passed the night there , and the next morning proceeded to the site of the ancient city of <unk> , from whence he was safely conducted back to <unk> by the <unk> , each party well satisfied with their <unk> .
After his return to France , in <unk> , he made several other <unk> abroad , and paid two visits to London .
At Paris he occupied himself with drawing , music , painting , writing , and <unk> .
He wrote the lives of the most celebrated <unk> and <unk> of the Royal <unk> , and founded in that <unk> an <unk> prize for the <unk> who were most successful in expressing the passions .
In 1742 he was <unk> an <unk> <unk> of &quot; L <unk> des <unk> , &quot; in which he founded another prize of five hundred livres for the best <unk> on the manners and customs of the <unk> .
He formed a splendid collection of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> <unk> , an account of which was published ( seven vols .
<unk> , the last in <unk> ) by Monsieur le <unk> .
He discovered the ancient art of <unk> painting , and of <unk> marble , from <unk> in the works of the elder <unk> .
But all this occupation and study did not prevent this <unk> <unk> and <unk> from indulging in the <unk> <unk> of literature .
He did not disdain to acknowledge the <unk> of a fairy tale , or to contribute to the number of them .
I have selected three from his _ <unk> <unk> _ , which are in my judgment the best , and display the greatest variety of style and power of imagination .
The first , -- PRINCESS MINUTE AND KING FLORIDOR .
_ La Princesse <unk> et le Roi Floridor _ is written in a spirit of <unk> <unk> , which <unk> one of those sprightly <unk> of fairy tales which flowed so pleasantly from the pen of Count <unk> ; but , <unk> _ Le <unk> _ and _ <unk> d <unk> _ of that accomplished <unk> , _ Princess Minute and King Floridor _ presents us with a sound and serious moral , which at this moment , when the sacrifice of important <unk> to <unk> and <unk> has caused so much <unk> , is <unk> _ <unk> _ .
It also <unk> a pleasant lesson to those who neglect or <unk> the great means and opportunities which it has pleased Providence to bestow upon them , and amidst all its <unk> <unk> , never <unk> to whisper in the words of <unk> Go to the <unk> , thou <unk> ; consider her ways and be wise .
Floridor was the name of a celebrated French <unk> of the seventeenth century .
In _ Le <unk> du <unk> _ , written by Le <unk> , and acted at the Fair of St. <unk> in <unk> , the <unk> <unk> of Destiny <unk> upon the vanity of an <unk> <unk> ce qui <unk> <unk> &apos;est <unk> or <unk> out <unk> ce <unk> , <unk> se <unk> un Floridor La <unk> <unk> !
THE IMPOSSIBLE ENCHANTMENT .
_ L <unk> Impossible _ is an amusing story with one <unk> , which I have ventured to correct by the <unk> of half a dozen lines , and the <unk> of an unnecessary <unk> .
<unk> the last , this is a mere work of fancy , without any particular <unk> sort of illustration of the old song and saying , _ Love will find out the way _ .
The Mer-man and his sister would seem to point out a Breton origin for this story , as the belief in these <unk> marvels is strong upon the coast of Brittany , where the females are called <unk> ( <unk> ) , or <unk> <unk> ( <unk> ) , and are supposed to draw down to their palaces of gold and crystal , at the bottom of the ocean , those who venture <unk> too near the <unk> of the water ; but the Count de <unk> was too well acquainted with the <unk> Tritons and Syrens to render it necessary for him to draw upon the <unk> of <unk> for such materials , and it is probable the story is entirely of his own <unk> .
The absurd <unk> in <unk> , <unk> at in this story , by the introduction of a fairy with her hair dressed _ en <unk> <unk> _ , are <unk> upon in a little volume called _ Histoires des <unk> Française _ ; <unk> and Paris , <unk> .
&quot; The number of these _ <unk> _ , &quot; says the writer , &quot; is almost infinite .
Every year , every month , <unk> new ones .
We have seen , in <unk> , hair dressed _ en <unk> _ ( <unk> fashion ) , _ en <unk> d <unk> _ ( <unk> fashion !
) , _ en <unk> <unk> _ ( broken stick !
) ; yesterday it was _ en <unk> de pigeon _ , to-day it is _ en <unk> _ . &quot;
BLEUETTE AND COQUELICOT .
_ Bleuette et Coquelicot _ is a charming fairy tale of the pastoral order , <unk> in its style , and <unk> in its <unk> .
I have only to add , in further illustration of the head-dress of Arganto ( p . <unk> ) , that &quot; <unk> _ <unk> _ <unk> &quot; was <unk> in <unk> at sixteen <unk> <unk> pound , by R. <unk> , at the sign of the &quot; <unk> , &quot; opposite New <unk> Court , <unk> ; and that receipts for making it occur as late as in <unk> &apos;s _ <unk> to the <unk> _ , in <unk> .
The author of _ L <unk> des <unk> Française _ , <unk> above , says he does not &quot; despair of one day seeing rose-coloured hair powder , blue heads , &quot; &amp; c . ; and in _ <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , we actually find receipts for making yellow , _ <unk> _ , and black hair powder ; while <unk> , in his _ <unk> of the <unk> _ , <unk> <unk> . , <unk> both black and _ blue _ .
MADEMOISELLE DE <unk> .
Of this lady we have but very <unk> information .
She was born about the year <unk> , and is said by some writers to have been the daughter of a <unk> ; and by others , of a &quot; <unk> de Marine . &quot;
She appears to have led a <unk> and retired life , her love of literature <unk> her to marriage .
Her _ Contes des Fées _ were commenced about <unk> ; and several have been attributed to her pen which she <unk> .
Those she acknowledged were : -- _ <unk> _ , _ La Princesse Lionette et le Prince Coquerico _ , _ Le Prince <unk> et la Princesse <unk> _ , _ La Princesse <unk> de <unk> et le Prince <unk> _ , _ La Princesse Camion _ , and _ La <unk> <unk> _ .
She was also the author of a translation of _ <unk> des <unk> _ , _ Les <unk> <unk> d <unk> _ , and _ <unk> <unk> _ , published in <unk> .
<unk> and <unk> called her &quot; <unk> et grace . &quot;
She was living in <unk> , and died before <unk> .
She had disappeared from society for some time previously , and was <unk> to be still living at that date ; but a letter written by some one who knew of her decease , <unk> in the _ <unk> de Paris _ of that year ( No .
<unk> ) , addressed to the author of _ L <unk> des <unk> <unk> _ , by &quot; l <unk> de Mademoiselle de Lubert , &quot; and <unk> from the &quot; <unk> et <unk> <unk> des <unk> <unk> , &quot; seems to have been considered sufficient authority ; though as no <unk> time or place is mentioned , the letter might have been written by the lady herself had she wished to deceive the public .
She had , however , reached a very <unk> age , and it is probable that she was dead at that period .
&quot; Her _ Contes des Fées _ , &quot; remarks one of her <unk> , &quot; are not nearly equal to those of Mademoiselle de Murat and other ladies who have written in that style .
They have less of moral purpose and <unk> allusion . &quot;
This is quite true ; and my object in <unk> the two I have selected is to <unk> , as I have mentioned in my <unk> , the decline of the Fairy tale .
Mademoiselle de Lubert is one of the <unk> of her class .
Her stories are only designed to amuse .
The publication of _ The <unk> and One Nights _ , by <unk> , and the immense popularity that work immediately obtained , evidently affected the composition of fairy tales .
<unk> , extravagant adventures , <unk> incidents , <unk> without point or object , a <unk> after the merely marvellous , and a <unk> <unk> of the laughing <unk> and the <unk> <unk> which distinguish and immortalize the stories of Perrault and d &apos;Aulnoy , were the first effects of the <unk> of the _ <unk> Nights <unk> _ .
The next was the <unk> of every tale of enchantment .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> the merry old Kings who &quot; once upon a time &quot; <unk> in Fairyland .
The <unk> of the <unk> and the <unk> were <unk> for the innocent <unk> of princes or shepherds .
The manners and dresses of the time , those delicious <unk> which impart so much <unk> , and <unk> the fairy tale , were carefully <unk> ; and the characters , <unk> in what the writers flattered themselves were <unk> <unk> , were seriously placed in <unk> compared to which that of Molière &apos;s _ Monsieur <unk> _ as _ <unk> _ was a nearer approach to <unk> .
Even those that had some claim to Oriental origin were so altered and &quot; <unk> for the <unk> <unk> &quot; that they were said to <unk> <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> &#91; <unk> &#93; Plus <unk> qu &apos;en <unk> .
_ Le <unk> <unk> _ was <unk> with these <unk> .
_ <unk> et <unk> , Conte <unk> _ ; _ <unk> et <unk> , Conte Oriental _ ; _ <unk> , Conte Oriental _ ; _ <unk> , <unk> Oriental _ , _ &amp; c . _ Then we have _ Contes <unk> _ , _ Contes <unk> _ , _ Contes <unk> _ , _ Contes <unk> _ , _ Contes <unk> _ , _ &amp; c . _ ; but we are forgetting Mademoiselle de Lubert and her FOOTNOTES : &#91; <unk> &#93; <unk> was the <unk> of the _ <unk> et une <unk> _ .
PRINCESS CAMION .
A translation of _ La Princesse Camion _ , much <unk> and altered , was published in the _ <unk> &apos;s Fairy <unk> _ some twenty years ago , under the title of _ Princess <unk> . _ The plot of this story is <unk> without being ingenious .
The persecution of Camion by Marmotte is purely <unk> , and her <unk> are of the <unk> description .
In the original , Zirphil is commanded to &quot; take off , one by one , the <unk> of the whale ; &quot; but a whale has no <unk> that it could feel the <unk> of .
It is skinning the fish alive that would be a cruel <unk> , and I have therefore rendered &quot; _ <unk> _ &quot; in that sense , and not to <unk> , as it had been previously translated , in accordance with the <unk> direction <unk> above .
The transformation of the unfortunate Princess into a crayfish , and her being <unk> instead of pounded as Marmotte had decreed , is all of the same character .
The long story told by her in that state to the other crayfish in the <unk> is a <unk> way of <unk> either Zirphil or the reader , and has to be continued in as <unk> a manner by Citronette .
The pounding the crayfish for the King &apos;s soup , and the <unk> of them in flames when they are put into the mortar , seems to point to an <unk> origin .
The latter portion <unk> us of the black man flinging the fish into the fire , in the story of &quot; The <unk> and the <unk> , &quot; in the _ <unk> Nights _ , where there is also a city changed into a lake , and all its inhabitants into <unk> , and <unk> in the end and restored to the <unk> monarch , the young King of the <unk> Island .
The crayfish broth may be an allusion to the <unk> _ <unk> d <unk> _ , but it is also an Oriental <unk> ; for while this book was passing through the press , a morning <unk> announced that &quot; the eldest royal son of his Majesty the First King of <unk> , &quot; on his arrival at <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; after <unk> himself that due <unk> had been made for the comfort of his <unk> , retired to rest , having first <unk> of a <unk> repast , prepared by his own _ <unk> _ , consisting of _ <unk> pounded _ with various <unk> <unk> . &quot;
-- _ Morning <unk> _ , <unk> <unk> , <unk> .
The eagerness with which the <unk> of the Court sought for the <unk> office of filling the King of the Whiting &apos;s bowl with <unk> , is the only stroke of <unk> in the story , and evidently <unk> at the <unk> and similar ceremonies of &quot; le grand et le <unk> <unk> . &quot;
To stand and hold a &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; while Louis XIV .
<unk> himself , was , says St. <unk> , &quot; une distinction et une <unk> qui se <unk> , tant le Roi <unk> l <unk> de <unk> l <unk> à des <unk> . &quot;
In a note to the expression , &quot; shrieks like Melusine &apos;s , &quot; page <unk> , I have suggested that some portion of _ Princess Camion _ might have been founded on the romance of _ Melusine _ .
This romance was composed towards the end of the fourteenth century , by Jean d <unk> , at the desire of the Duke de <unk> , son of John , King of France , and was founded on an incident <unk> in the <unk> of the family of Lusignan , which were in possession of the Duke .
It is <unk> as <unk> : -- THE <unk> OF <unk> .
A King of <unk> , named <unk> , had married the beautiful <unk> <unk> , by whom he had three daughters at a birth , Melusine , <unk> , and <unk> .
<unk> had <unk> that he should never enter her chamber during the period of her <unk> ; but the King having broken his promise in his anxiety to embrace his <unk> children , the Queen cried out that she was compelled to leave him , and immediately disappeared with her three daughters .
She retired to the Court of her sister , the Queen of the &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; and as her children grew up , <unk> them in the art of <unk> .
Melusine having learned from her mother the conduct of her father , determined to be revenged on him , and proceeding to <unk> , by means of her <unk> art carried off the King and shut him up in a mountain called <unk> .
The Queen , who still retained some affection for her husband , on becoming acquainted with this unnatural act , punished Melusine by <unk> her to become every <unk> a serpent from the waist <unk> , till she should meet with a lover who would marry her on condition of never <unk> on her during the time of her transformation , when she was ordered to bathe ; with a promise that if she strictly attended to this <unk> , she might eventually be relieved from her <unk> <unk> and punishment .
Melusine was excessively beautiful , and <unk> , son of the Count de <unk> , having met with her in the forest of <unk> , &#91; <unk> &#93; fell in love with her so deeply that he married her without hesitation on the prescribed conditions .
She built for him , near the spot where they had met , the Castle of Lusignan , and bore him several children ; but her husband &apos;s jealousy being excited by a <unk> , who suggested to him that Melusine had a criminal object in <unk> herself on a <unk> , he made a hole with his sword in the door of the chamber to which she was <unk> to retire , and perceived her in her state of transformation .
The various <unk> of this legend differ in the details of the consequences ; but all agree in <unk> that Melusine , reproaching him with the <unk> of his word , disappeared , and left him to end his days as a hermit on <unk> .
The popular belief was , that she appeared on what was called the Tower of Melusine when any of the lords of Lusignan were about to die ; and <unk> <unk> us , on the faith &quot; of people who were not by any means credulous , &quot; that previous to the death of a Lusignan , or of a king of France , she was seen on this tower in a <unk> dress , and uttered for a long time the most <unk> lamentations .
The Duke de <unk> destroyed the castle in <unk> , on account of the resistance made to his arms in it by the <unk> ; but the family of Lusignan , till it <unk> in that of <unk> , continued to bear for its <unk> a woman bathing , in allusion to the story of Melusine .
<unk> par la figure , et serpent par la <unk> _ <unk> . _ PRINCESS LIONETTE AND PRINCE COQUERICO .
_ La Princesse Lionette et le Prince Coquerico _ is an infinitely better story than _ La Princesse Camion _ : but , like that , its <unk> is no higher than to excite the interest and awaken the wonder of its readers .
As a work of fancy , however , it is one of the best of its class , and I believe is now for the first time translated into English .
I do not <unk> any story on which it could be said to be founded ; but at the end of _ La <unk> des Fées <unk> _ , by the Countess d <unk> , is a story , entitled _ La Princesse <unk> _ , in which a princess is changed into a lioness , and persecuted by a fairy called La <unk> ; but there the <unk> <unk> .
Mademoiselle de Lubert <unk> an edition of the _ <unk> Contes des Fées _ of the Countess d <unk> , and may have taken an idea from that particular incident .
The model of the <unk> in which Prince Coquerico saw and heard all that passed in the universe , and witnessed the opera , the play , and the <unk> at the _ Académie Française _ , <unk> one of the room in the Palace of the Beast , the various windows of which afforded Beauty similar entertainment .
The Fairy Tigreline &apos;s <unk> of spinning and <unk> pearls , is in strict accordance with the manners of the <unk> century .
&quot; <unk> <unk> les <unk> , &quot; says <unk> , &quot; <unk> <unk> et <unk> <unk> _ à <unk> les <unk> ou à <unk> _ , <unk> <unk> . &quot;
<unk> <unk> <unk> .
<unk> .
I have mentioned ( p . <unk> ) that the opera of _ <unk> _ was considered the _ <unk> <unk> _ of <unk> .
The music was composed by <unk> , and it is reported that he made <unk> write the last act over again five times , which so disgusted the <unk> that he ceased to write for the stage from that period .
The incident of the shield is that in which <unk> <unk> before <unk> his <unk> or diamond shield , in which the latter <unk> himself reflected in his <unk> attire , is awakened to a sense of his <unk> situation , and <unk> the enchanted gardens of <unk> <unk> .
FOOTNOTES : &#91; <unk> &#93; At a spring called the <unk> of <unk> , or the <unk> of the <unk> , &quot; <unk> called &apos; La <unk> des _ <unk> &apos; _ &quot; ( says a writer in <unk> ) , and every year , in the month of May , a fair is held in the neighbouring <unk> , when the <unk> sell figures of women &apos; _ <unk> <unk> , _ &apos; called &apos; <unk> . &apos;
MADAME <unk> DE <unk> .
<unk> <unk> DE <unk> was born at <unk> , in <unk> , and commenced her <unk> <unk> in <unk> , by the production of a romance , called _ La <unk> de la <unk> _ ; shortly after which she came to England , and resided in London for a considerable time , <unk> herself as a governess , and in writing works for the <unk> as well as the amusement of youth .
That which acquired the most popularity was _ Le <unk> des <unk> _ , in which appeared her <unk> of _ Beauty and the Beast _ , and her original _ Fairy Tales _ .
She was twice married .
Her first was an unfortunate union , <unk> almost immediately afterwards .
Her second marriage took place in England , but to a <unk> ; and in <unk> she returned to France for the benefit of her native air .
In <unk> , she purchased a small <unk> , called <unk> , and died in <unk> .
Her <unk> works amount to <unk> <unk> ; but even _ Le <unk> des <unk> _ is scarcely remembered in the present day , and the four short fairy tales which terminate this volume are , with the <unk> of _ Beauty and the Beast _ , the only <unk> by which she is <unk> known in England .
The best of them is PRINCE DÉSIR AND PRINCESS <unk> .
It is more like one of the good old Breton <unk> , short , and with a sound moral .
PRINCE CHÉRI , <unk> into &quot; Prince <unk> &quot; in our children &apos;s books , <unk> the influence of the <unk> from the <unk> .
But that it has so <unk> a moral , it might pass for a French alteration of an Oriental tale .
The names of Suliman and Zélie would encourage the suspicion .
THE WIDOW AND HER TWO DAUGHTERS .
_ La <unk> et <unk> <unk> <unk> _ is better known by the title of _ Blanche and <unk> _ , under which it has been frequently printed , and was also produced on the French stage by Mons .
<unk> , in <unk> , <unk> .
The moral of the story is declared by the Fairy to be that excessively <unk> and common-place <unk> , that happiness consists in content , or , in the words of the author , the possession of things only that are necessary without wishing for more ; but the author forgot to show us that Blanche was discontented .
It does not appear that she wished for <unk> , or to be a &quot; great Queen , &quot; or that such an idea ever entered her head till the Fairy promised her she should become one , &quot; not to reward , &quot; but &quot; to punish , &quot; her for <unk> to give away her plums .
Poor Blanche is therefore made an _ unhappy _ queen ; her low birth renders her an object of contempt at Court ; the King is a <unk> person , who <unk> the innocent girl his passion induced him to place upon his throne , and who is the mother of his children ; and at length the miserable wife <unk> that &quot; happiness is not to be found in magnificent palaces but in the innocent occupations of the country . &quot;
Now this is <unk> is worse , for it is false and <unk> .
There is as much happiness in palaces and on <unk> , thank God , as there is in <unk> .
The occupations of a virtuous sovereign are as innocent as those of a <unk> , while the power to do good , existing with the will , must make the <unk> of happiness greatly in favour of the former .
The cares of State are <unk> enough , no doubt , and the more <unk> the monarch , the <unk> the sense of <unk> ; but has the countryman no cares , no sorrows , no _ vices _ ?
The <unk> occupations of all <unk> are &quot; innocent . &quot;
Is it only kings and <unk> who yield to <unk> or indulge in the evil <unk> of our common nature ?
There has been too much of this <unk> <unk> into what are called moral stories , and at the risk of being accused of breaking a butterfly on the <unk> , I have <unk> out this particular instance , as _ Blanche and <unk> _ is to be found in almost every child &apos;s <unk> .
That the author &apos;s intention was laudable , I do not doubt ; but to read a <unk> lesson , she should have shown Blanche to have been discontented with the lot <unk> to her by Providence , <unk> to <unk> in society for which she was neither fitted by birth nor education , and dreaming that happiness consisted solely in rank , wealth , and luxury .
The moral should have been , not that such <unk> were incompatible with virtue and happiness , but that their <unk> were not exempted from the <unk> and sufferings of humanity , and that <unk> <unk> were rarely fortunate ones .
All this , it will be said , she might mean , but it is not evident ; and the only impression made upon a child &apos;s mind by this story , if any impression can be made by it whatever , is the very absurd and <unk> one , that all kings and <unk> are wicked and unhappy , and all <unk> and <unk> virtuous and contented .
PRINCE FATAL AND PRINCE FORTUNÉ .
This is another of the moral Fairy Tales of Madame de Beaumont , and , as _ Fatal and Fortuné _ , a great favourite with the <unk> of children &apos;s <unk> .
It is <unk> in tone than the preceding : the value of adversity is difficult to <unk> on a young mind , and it is pointed out in this little tale as well , perhaps , as it could be ; but there is one observation I must venture to make in reference to a point of taste .
The writers of the old Fairy Tales never <unk> up the <unk> with fairies and <unk> .
The superior powers are invariably the <unk> divinities of ancient <unk> and <unk> .
Their heroes and <unk> pray to &quot; the gods , &quot; not to &quot; God . &quot;
The introduction of the <unk> name is , I am well aware , too frequent in familiar French conversation , to render it a matter of <unk> in the original language ; and I fully acquit Madame de Beaumont of any <unk> <unk> ; but it is a fact worthy of remark , that in an age and at a Court which are described as particularly <unk> , the writers for youth or entertainment carefully <unk> from an unnecessary <unk> of which they had <unk> enough in the older <unk> and romances , not only of their own country , but throughout Europe ; and that although the <unk> of these authors were in the highest <unk> of <unk> of the circle that surrounded the throne of one of the most <unk> monarchs in the <unk> <unk> never spared the <unk> or the crimes of princes , or the <unk> and <unk> of their <unk> .
The <unk> frankness , indeed , with which they <unk> the follies and <unk> against the vices of the great , is as honourable to them as their perfect freedom from that <unk> <unk> which would <unk> in any class the existence of virtue and the enjoyment of happiness founded upon it .
Madame de Beaumont &apos;s <unk> that such may be the case concludes her story of _ Fatal and Fortuné _ more <unk> than her <unk> to the contrary does that of _ The Widow and her Two <unk> _ .
So much has been said in this Appendix about _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ and _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse _ , that although , as in the case of _ Prince <unk> _ and _ Le <unk> _ , in my former volume , I have not included them in the body of the work , I think it may be as well , as in the above instance , to give in this place an <unk> of their plots , they being undoubtedly two of the oldest fairy tales of their class on <unk> .
<unk> D <unk> .
A Princess , in order to escape the persecution of the King , her father , on a point of <unk> , <unk> a fairy , who is her godmother , and by her advice <unk> requests her father to give her three <unk> first of the colour of the sky , the second of the colour of the moon , and the third of the colour of the sun , believing he will be unable to fulfil his promises .
He succeeds , however , in <unk> for her the three dresses ; and she is then <unk> to ask him for the skin of a marvellous ass in the royal <unk> , which <unk> the King daily with an ample quantity of gold coin , under the impression that his Majesty will never consent to such a sacrifice .
The <unk> Monarch , however , does cause the ass to be killed and <unk> , and the Princess , on the receipt of the skin she has requested , is reduced to flight .
The Fairy tells her to put the three fine dresses and all her <unk> , &amp; <unk> in a large trunk , which by <unk> power is to follow her <unk> , and appear whenever she needs it ; and <unk> her face and hands , and <unk> herself up in the ass &apos;s skin , the Princess <unk> from the palace , and travels into the dominions of a neighbouring monarch .
She there <unk> <unk> in a farm as a <unk> and <unk> of the <unk> and poultry , her only pleasure consisting in occasionally <unk> herself up in her miserable room , and putting on her fine dresses and <unk> , which appear at her wish , as the Fairy promised her .
The son of the King of this country <unk> to visit this farm occasionally as he returns from hunting , and one day <unk> through the <unk> of the door , and <unk> Peau d &apos;Ane ( as the Princess is called , from the only dress she <unk> in public ) <unk> in one of her richest robes .
He is dazzled with her beauty , and believing her to be some divinity , he is afraid to burst open the door , and returns to the palace , where he <unk> perfectly <unk> , <unk> to eat , drink , or take any amusement .
He <unk> who lives in that wretched room at the farm , and is told an ugly , dirty , kitchen <unk> , called Peau d &apos;Ane , for the reason aforesaid .
He <unk> that nothing can <unk> him but a cake made by her hands .
After all sorts of <unk> , they yield to his wishes , and Peau d &apos;Ane is ordered to make a cake for the Prince .
She has seen him on his visits to the farm , and is equally in love with him .
She makes the cake , and drops , by accident or design , a magnificent emerald ring into it .
The Prince <unk> the cake , and <unk> the ring .
He immediately <unk> that he will marry no one but the woman who <unk> that ring .
On this determination being made public , all the <unk> ladies in the Court and kingdom endeavour to fit on the ring , but it is too small for any one to pretend to the <unk> .
At length Peau d &apos;Ane is sent for at the Prince &apos;s wish , and <unk> her hideous ass &apos;s skin , appears in magnificent attire , and places the ring easily on her finger .
Everybody is astonished , the Prince and his parents delighted , and the nuptials take place , being honoured by the presence of Kings and Fairies from all quarters , and specially by the father of the Princess , who has recovered from his <unk> .
This story , founded <unk> on the legend of St. <unk> , was a favourite in France from an exceedingly early period , and was <unk> by Perrault , and published with _ Les Souhaits Ridicules _ , as I have already stated , in 1694 .
He alludes to the original nursery tale in his _ <unk> des <unk> et des <unk> _ , <unk> , in which he makes the <unk> of the <unk> say , &quot; Les <unk> <unk> sont <unk> <unk> , que c &apos;est leur <unk> <unk> d <unk> que de leur <unk> <unk> Contes de _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ et de _ la Mère l &apos;Oye _ . &quot;
The prose version of this tale was not published until many years after his death , and is supposed by Baron <unk> not to have been his composition ; and I think there is a point <unk> by the Baron which <unk> that opinion .
The story is dedicated to Mademoiselle <unk> de Lubert .
&#91; <unk> &#93; Now , if this be Mademoiselle de Lubert , author of _ La Princesse Camion _ , &amp; c . , she was not born till some years after the death of Perrault ; and as in the dedication we find the lines &quot; <unk> <unk> <unk> à l <unk> , <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; the dedication itself could not have been written much before <unk> , Mademoiselle de Lubert having been born about <unk> .
There is another story in the _ Contes ou <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> _ , <unk> <unk> , of a young girl named &quot; Peau d &apos;Ane , &quot; and &quot; how she got married by the means furnished her by the <unk> . &quot;
A gentleman fell in love with a merchant &apos;s daughter , named <unk> .
The father and mother , not daring <unk> to refuse their consent , attached to it what they considered an impossible <unk> , that for a given period previous to her marriage the girl should wear no other apparel than the skin of an ass .
<unk> , returning the gentleman &apos;s affection , was not to be discouraged by this obstacle , and cheerfully wore the skin of an ass for the appointed time .
<unk> in this matter , they set their wits to work to <unk> something more <unk> .
They insisted that she should <unk> up , <unk> by <unk> , a <unk> of <unk> , which they <unk> for that purpose on the ground .
Nothing daunted , she applied herself to this task ; but the <unk> repaired to the same spot , and took away all the <unk> by degrees , without being noticed , so that it appeared as if <unk> had done it ; and her parents considering further opposition useless , the girl obtained her husband .
The story concludes with the assertion that &quot; <unk> <unk> que tant <unk> <unk> le <unk> de Peau d &apos;Ane <unk> <unk> . &quot;
There is nothing whatever in this story to remind one of the last , beyond the simple circumstance of the skin ; nor have we any clue as to which may be the oldest : but both were called _ Peau d &apos;Ane _ , and it may be just possible that one furnished a hint for the other , or , indeed , that there was a collection of stories so entitled ; for La <unk> , the <unk> of Louis XIV . , tells us , in his _ <unk> _ , that when that monarch was still a child , but had passed from the hands of females into those of men , he could not go to sleep &quot; <unk> <unk> ne <unk> <unk> <unk> _ les contes _ de Peau d &apos;Ane <unk> que les <unk> qui le <unk> <unk> <unk> de le <unk> . &quot;
L <unk> <unk> ; <unk> , <unk> <unk> DE <unk> .
A King <unk> for the <unk> <unk> to a Fairy the charge of his three <unk> , <unk> , and Finette , names <unk> of their characters .
They are shut up in a tower without a door , and furnished with three enchanted <unk> of glass , which they are told will break on the commission of any <unk> .
They were to be provided with everything they might <unk> require by means of a basket let up and down by a <unk> and <unk> fixed on the top of the tower .
The two eldest Princesses soon become weary of solitude , and one day <unk> up in the basket an old <unk> woman , <unk> <unk> she will be her servant , and <unk> being anxious to have <unk> else to talk to .
The <unk> woman proves to be a Prince disguised , the son of a neighbouring King who is a <unk> enemy of the father of the three Princesses , and who has had recourse to this <unk> in order to revenge himself for some <unk> or injury he has sustained .
By flattering the <unk> of the two Princesses who introduced him into the tower , he succeeds in causing them to break both their <unk> , but all his <unk> are <unk> by Finette ( L &apos;Adroite Princesse ) , who <unk> rid of him by making him fall through a <unk> door into the <unk> under the tower .
<unk> at his <unk> , he has recourse to another scheme , and succeeds in inducing Finette to descend in the basket to <unk> assistance for her sisters , who are suffering from the consequences of their <unk> .
He <unk> Finette , and is about to have her rolled down a <unk> in a tub filled with <unk> , when she <unk> <unk> him into it , and he <unk> the fate he had <unk> for the Princess .
<unk> hurt , he <unk> his vengeance to his brother , who <unk> to him that he will marry Finette , and murder her on the night of his nuptials .
She , however , places a figure of straw in the bed , which the Prince <unk> <unk> , and is only too delighted to find he is not guilty of <unk> a woman he loves , and who <unk> his happy Queen .
This story was not published till 1742 , when it was printed as Perrault &apos;s , although it was well known that Mademoiselle Lheritier , who had read Perrault &apos;s _ Histoires du Temps Passé _ in <unk> , had conceived from them the idea of trying her hand at the same sort of composition , and had actually published , in <unk> , this very story , under the title of _ Les <unk> de Finette _ in her _ <unk> <unk> _ , with a letter to the daughter of Perrault .
<unk> of that very story she <unk> &quot; <unk> <unk> que dans le _ Conte de Finette _ , les <unk> <unk> sont <unk> <unk> d <unk> <unk> <unk> que <unk> les <unk> , on ne <unk> point de <unk> : ce sont <unk> <unk> <unk> de qui on <unk> des <unk> <unk> <unk> les <unk> <unk> ; &quot; and she also <unk> , &quot; <unk> &apos;ai pour <unk> la tradition qui met ce Conte de _ Finette _ ; au Temps des <unk> . &quot;
There cannot surely be more evidence required to <unk> the assertion of Mr. Dunlop , that _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse _ ( be it written by Perrault or Mademoiselle Lheritier ) is taken from the _ Pentamerone _ , with little <unk> of <unk> or incident .
The story he alludes to is the fourth of the third day , and is entitled _ <unk> <unk> _ .
There is no such name as Finette in it , and it is well known , <unk> of Mademoiselle Lheritier &apos;s declaration , that _ Le Conte de Finette _ was one of the oldest of the French nursery tales .
Nor can we desire clearer evidence of the way in which these stories were written than that which is afforded to us by the repeated acknowledgments of Mademoiselle Lheritier : -- &quot; <unk> que <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> au fond <unk> <unk> <unk> qu <unk> ma conté <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . &quot;
And , again , -- &quot; <unk> <unk> ma <unk> on ma <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ce <unk> <unk> <unk> des <unk> <unk> <unk> &apos;ai <unk> qu <unk> un <unk> de <unk> . &quot;
Let any one compare these lines with those of the concluding portion of the story of _ L &apos;Adroite Princesse _ commencing &quot; <unk> Madame , &quot; &amp; c . , and they must be struck by the singular resemblance .
* * * * * There will be many general readers , and perhaps some <unk> , who may think I have been <unk> minute in my notes and humble attempts at illustration ; but whilst I feel that the fairy tales I have selected contain in themselves nothing that may not afford innocent entertainment to children , I certainly hope that the little information I have been able to collect respecting some hitherto obscure and disputed points may give both this and the book that preceded it an interest in the eyes of elder readers , who may meet , where they least expect it , some fact or <unk> , trifling in itself , but <unk> a clue to more important matter .
My principal object has been , however , in this volume , to <unk> the minds of those who have taken for granted the <unk> of our <unk> of <unk> concerning the original <unk> from whence Perrault and Madame d &apos;Aulnoy in particular derived the plots of their fairy <unk> which I confess I had not thought necessary to notice until , in a kind and <unk> <unk> of my former volume , it was <unk> regretted as an <unk> .
I trust I have now made it perfectly clear that whether or not the writers of those tales were <unk> of the existence in the <unk> of Straparola and <unk> of some <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> of stories told for ages in all the <unk> of Europe and <unk> , that the real foundation of those of Perrault were the old Breton _ Contes de ma Mère l &apos;Oye _ , which in company &quot; <unk> Peau d &apos;Ane et de <unk> à <unk> <unk> de <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> , &quot; he had heard in his own nursery , and with which Louis XIV .
had been <unk> to sleep when a child , as well as all the rest of the children in his dominions ; and that Madame d &apos;Aulnoy , when not indebted to similar recollections , drew upon her own <unk> and lively imagination , <unk> occasionally an incident from one of the old <unk> of <unk> , or some of those Oriental stories which were circulated in <unk> long before their publication by <unk> , or picked up by herself during her residence in <unk> from the <unk> and <unk> slaves around her , <unk> , from her own little servant <unk> , who , though she could speak no language but her own at the time her mistress so pleasantly <unk> her , might have eventually acquired sufficient French or Spanish for such a purpose .
Her account of this child is so interesting that I shall not <unk> for <unk> it : -- &quot; They have here great numbers of slaves who are bought and sold at high <unk> .
They are Moors and <unk> , some of them worth four or five hundred crowns a piece .... You are extremely well served by these unhappy wretches , they are far more diligent , <unk> , and humble than other servants ....
I have one that is not above <unk> years old .
She is as black as <unk> , and would be reckoned in her own country a wonderful beauty , for her nose is quite <unk> , her lips <unk> thick , her eyes of a red and white colour , and her teeth admirable in Europe as well as in <unk> .
She <unk> not a word of any language than her own .
Her name is <unk> ; we have got her <unk> .... Those who sold her to me told me she was a girl of quality ; and the poor child will come often and fall down on her knees before me , clasp her hands , cry , and point towards her country .
I would willingly send her thither if she could there be a <unk> ; but this impossibility <unk> me to keep her .
_ I would <unk> understand her , for I believe her to be intelligent _ <unk> her actions show it .
She <unk> after her fashion , and so pleasantly that she <unk> us much entertainment .
I make her wear white patches , with which she is <unk> taken .
She is dressed as they are at <unk> , that is , in a short gown almost without any <unk> , large <unk> <unk> of fine cloth <unk> with different colours like those of our <unk> and <unk> .
A pair of <unk> made of merely a <unk> of crimson velvet on a gold ground , and fastened at the sides with silver <unk> and <unk> , and a mantle of exceedingly fine <unk> stuff , very long and very large , in which she <unk> herself , and with one corner of it <unk> her head .
&quot; This dress is very handsome ; her short hair , which looks like wool , is cut in several places , on each side like a <unk> , on the crown in a circle , and in front like a heart .
She cost me twenty <unk> .
My daughter has made her governess of her <unk> , the little monkey given to her by the <unk> of <unk> .
I assure you <unk> and the <unk> are <unk> <unk> , and understand each other extremely well . &quot;
-- _ <unk> du <unk> en <unk> . _ With this <unk> and <unk> <unk> from a book deserving to be better known , I leave a subject to which it is not likely I shall return in <unk> , though it will never cease to interest me in the study .
