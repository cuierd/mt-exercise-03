The gentleman who had been entrusted to try the slipper , having attentively looked at Cinderella and found her to be very handsome , said that it was a very proper request , and that he had been ordered to try the slipper on all girls without exception .
He made Cinderella sit down , and putting the slipper to her little foot , he saw it go on easily and fit like wax .
Great was the astonishment of the two sisters , but it was still greater when Cinderella took the other little slipper out of her pocket and put it on her other foot .
At that moment the godmother arrived , who having given a tap with her wand to Cinderella &apos;s clothes , they became still more magnificent than all the others she had appeared in .
The two sisters then recognised in her the beautiful person they had seen at the ball .
They threw themselves at her feet to <unk> her forgiveness for all the <unk> she had suffered from them .
Cinderella raised and embracing them , said that she <unk> them with all her heart , and begged them to love her dearly for the future .
They conducted her to the young Prince , dressed just as she was .
He found her handsomer than ever , and a few days afterwards he married her .
Cinderella , who was as kind as she was beautiful , gave her sisters apartments in the palace , and married them the very same day to two great lords of the court .
Beauty in woman is a treasure rare <unk> we are never weary of admiring ; But a sweet temper is a gift more fair And better worth the youthful maid &apos;s desiring .
That was the boon bestowed on Cinderella By her wise <unk> <unk> glory .
The rest was &quot; <unk> but <unk> and <unk> . &quot;
Such is the moral of this little <unk> <unk> , that charm <unk> you more than dress , And <unk> a heart with far greater facility .
In short , in all things to ensure success , The real Fairy gift is <unk> !
<unk> <unk> , courage , wit , and worth Are rare gifts to own on earth .
But if you want to <unk> at <unk> So , at least , the wise <unk> You will find you need some others , Such as <unk> or <unk> .
RIQUET WITH THE TUFT .
Once upon a time there was a Queen , who was brought to bed of a son so ugly and so <unk> that it was for a long time <unk> if he possessed a human form .
A Fairy , who was present at his birth , <unk> that he would not fail to be amiable , as he would have much <unk> .
She added , even , that he would be able , in consequence of the gift she had endowed him with , to impart equal intelligence to the person he should love best .
All this consoled the poor Queen a little , who was much distressed at having brought into the world so hideous a little monkey .
It is true that the child was no sooner able to speak than he said a thousand pretty things , and that there was in all his actions an <unk> air of intelligence which charmed one .
I had forgotten to say that he was born with a little tuft of hair on his head , which occasioned him to be named Riquet with the Tuft ; for Riquet was the family name .
At the end of seven or eight years , the Queen of a neighbouring kingdom was brought to bed of two daughters .
The first that came into the world was <unk> than day .
The Queen was so delighted , that it was feared her great joy would prove <unk> to her .
The same Fairy who had assisted at the birth of little Riquet with the Tuft was present upon this occasion , and to moderate the joy of the Queen , she declared to her that this little Princess would have no mental <unk> , and that she would be as stupid as she was beautiful .
This mortified the Queen exceedingly ; but a few minutes afterwards she experienced a very much greater annoyance , for the second girl she gave birth to , proved to be extremely ugly .
&quot; Do not distress yourself so much , Madam , &quot; said the Fairy to her .
&quot; Your daughter will find <unk> ; she will have so much sense that her lack of beauty will scarcely be perceived . &quot;
&quot; Heaven send it may be so , &quot; replied the Queen ; &quot; but are there no means of giving a little sense to the eldest , who is so lovely ? &quot;
&quot; I can do nothing for her , Madam , in the way of wit , &quot; said the Fairy , &quot; but everything in that of beauty ; and as there is nothing in my power that I would not do to gratify you , I will endow her with the ability to render beautiful the person who shall please her . &quot;
As these two Princesses grew up , their <unk> increased in the same proportion , and nothing was talked of anywhere but the beauty of the eldest and the intelligence of the youngest .
It is true that their defects also greatly increased with their years .
The youngest became <unk> every instant , and the eldest more stupid every day .
She either made no answer when she was spoken to , or she said something foolish .
With this she was so <unk> , that she could not place four pieces of <unk> on a <unk> without breaking one of them , nor drink a glass of water without <unk> half of it on her dress .
Notwithstanding the great advantage of beauty to a girl , the youngest bore away the <unk> from her sister nearly always , in every society .
At first they gathered round the handsomest , to gaze at and admire her ; but they soon left her for the <unk> , to listen to a thousand agreeable things ; and people were astonished to find that , in less than a quarter of an hour , the eldest had not a soul near her , and that all the company had formed a circle round the youngest .
The former , though very stupid , noticed this , and would have given , without regret , all her beauty for half the sense of her sister .
The Queen , <unk> as she was , could not help reproaching her frequently with her folly , which made the poor Princess ready to die of grief .
One day that she had withdrawn into a wood to <unk> her misfortune , she saw a little man approach her , of most disagreeable appearance , but dressed very magnificently .
It was the young Prince Riquet with the Tuft , who , having fallen in love with her from seeing her portraits , which were sent all round the world , had quitted his father &apos;s kingdom to have the pleasure of beholding and speaking to her .
Enchanted to meet her thus alone , he accosted her with all the respect and <unk> imaginable .
Having remarked , after paying the usual compliments , that she was very melancholy , he said to her , &quot; I cannot comprehend , Madam , how a person so beautiful as you are can be so sad as you appear ; for though I may boast of having seen an <unk> of lovely women , I can <unk> that I have never beheld one whose beauty could be compared to yours . &quot;
&quot; You are pleased to say so , <unk> , &quot; replied the Princess ; and there she stopped .
&quot; Beauty , &quot; continued Riquet , &quot; is so great an advantage , that it ought to surpass all others ; and when one possesses it , I do not see anything that could very much distress you . &quot;
&quot; I had rather , &quot; said the Princess , &quot; be as ugly as you , and have good sense , than possess the beauty I do , and be as stupid as I am . &quot;
&quot; There is no greater proof of good sense , Madam , than the belief that we have it not ; it is the nature of that gift , that the more we have , the more we believe we are deficient of it . &quot;
&quot; I do not know how that may be , &quot; said the Princess , &quot; but I know well enough that I am very stupid , and that is the cause of the grief which is <unk> me . &quot;
&quot; If that is all that afflicts you , Madam , I can easily put an end to your sorrow . &quot;
&quot; And how would you do that ? &quot;
said the Princess .
&quot; I have the power , Madam , &quot; said Riquet with the Tuft , &quot; to give as much wit as any one can possess to the person I love the most ; and as you , Madam , are that person , it will depend entirely upon yourself whether or not you will have so much wit , provided that you are willing to marry me . &quot;
The Princess was <unk> , and replied not a word .
&quot; I see , &quot; said Riquet with the Tuft , &quot; that this proposal pains you ; and I am not surprised at it ; but I give you a full year to consider of it . &quot;
The Princess had so little sense , and at the same time was so anxious to have a great deal , that she thought the end of that year would never come ; so she accepted at once the offer that was made her .
She had no sooner promised Riquet with the Tuft that she would marry him that day twelve months , than she felt herself to be quite another person to what she was previously .
She found she possessed an incredible facility of saying anything she wished , and of saying it in a <unk> , yet easy and natural manner .
She commenced on the instant , and kept up a sprightly conversation with Riquet with the Tuft , during which she <unk> away at such a rate , that Riquet with the Tuft began to believe he had given her more wit than he had kept for himself .
When she returned to the Palace , the whole Court was <unk> to account for a change so sudden and extraordinary , for in proportion to the number of foolish things they had heard her say formerly , were the sensible and exceedingly clever observations she now gave utterance to .
All the Court was in a state of joy which is not to be conceived .
The younger sister alone was not very much pleased , as no longer possessing over her elder sister the advantage of wit , she now only appeared , by her side , as a very <unk> person .
The King was now led by his eldest daughter &apos;s advice , and sometimes even held his Council in her apartment .
The news of this alteration having spread abroad , all the young Princes of the neighbouring kingdoms exerted themselves to obtain her affection , and nearly all of them asked her hand in marriage ; but she found none of them sufficiently intelligent , and she listened to all of them without <unk> herself to any one .
At length arrived a Prince so rich , so <unk> , and so handsome , that she could not help feeling an inclination for him .
Her father , having perceived it , told her that he left her at perfect liberty to choose a husband for herself , and that she had only to make known her decision .
As the more sense we possess , the more difficulty we find in making up one &apos;s mind positively on such a matter , she requested , after having thanked her father , that he would allow her some time to think of it .
She went , by chance , to walk in the same wood where she had met with Riquet with the Tuft , in order to <unk> with greater freedom on what she had to do .
While she was walking , deep in thought , she heard a dull sound beneath her feet , as of many persons running to and <unk> , and <unk> occupied .
Having listened more attentively , she heard one say , &quot; <unk> me that <unk> ; &quot; another , &quot; Give me that <unk> ; &quot; another , &quot; <unk> some wood on the fire . &quot;
At the same moment the ground opened , and she saw beneath her what appeared to be a large kitchen , full of cooks , <unk> , and all sorts of servants necessary for the preparation of a magnificent banquet .
There came forth a band of from twenty to thirty cooks , who went and established themselves in an avenue of the wood at a very long table , and who , each with larding-pin in hand and _ the queue de renard _ &#91; 7 &#93; behind the ear , set to work , keeping time to a melodious song .
The Princess , astonished at this sight , inquired for whom they were working .
&quot; Madam , &quot; replied the most <unk> of the troop , &quot; for Prince Riquet with the Tuft , whose marriage will take place to-morrow . &quot;
The Princess , still more surprised than she was before , and suddenly recollecting that it was just a <unk> from the day on which she had promised to marry Prince Riquet with the Tuft , was lost in amazement .
The cause of her not having remembered her promise was , that when she made it she was a fool , and on receiving her new mind , she forgot all her follies .
She had not taken thirty steps in <unk> of her walk , when Riquet with the Tuft presented himself before her , <unk> and magnificently attired , like a Prince about to be married .
&quot; You see , Madam , &quot; said he , &quot; I keep my word <unk> , and I doubt not but that you have come hither to keep yours , and to make me , by the gift of your hand , the happiest of men . &quot;
&quot; I confess to you , frankly , &quot; replied the Princess , &quot; that I have not yet made up my mind on that matter , and that I do not think I shall ever be able to do so to your satisfaction . &quot;
&quot; You astonish me , Madam , &quot; said Riquet with the Tuft .
&quot; I have no doubt I do , &quot; said the Princess ; &quot; and assuredly , had I to deal with a stupid <unk> man without mind , --I should feel greatly embarrassed .
<unk> Princess is bound by her word , &apos; he would say to me , &apos; and you must marry me , as you have promised to do so . &apos;
But as the person to whom I speak is the most sensible man in all the world , I am certain he will listen to reason .
You know that , when I was no better than a fool , I nevertheless could not resolve to marry <unk> can you expect , now that I have the sense which you have given me , and which renders me much more difficult to please than before , that I should take a resolution to-day which I could not do then ?
If you seriously thought of marrying me , you did very wrong to take away my stupidity , and enable me to see clearer than I saw then . &quot;
&quot; If a man without sense , &quot; replied Riquet with the Tuft , &quot; should meet with some indulgence , as you have just <unk> , had he to reproach you with your <unk> of promise , why would you , Madam , that I should not be equally so in a matter which <unk> the entire happiness of my life ?
Is it reasonable that persons of intellect should be in a worse condition than those that have none ?
Can you assert <unk> who have so much and have so earnestly desired to possess it ?
But let us come to the point , if you please .
With the exception of my ugliness , is there anything in me that <unk> you ?
Are you <unk> with my birth , my understanding , my temper , or my manners ? &quot;
&quot; Not in the least , &quot; replied the Princess ; &quot; I admire in you everything you have mentioned . &quot;
&quot; If so , &quot; rejoined Riquet with the Tuft , &quot; I shall be happy , as you have it in your power to make me the most agreeable of men . &quot;
&quot; How can that be done ? &quot;
said the Princess .
&quot; It can be done , &quot; said Riquet with the Tuft , &quot; if you love me sufficiently to wish that it should be .
And in order , Madam , that you should have no doubt about it , know that the same fairy , who , on the day I was born , endowed me with the power to give understanding to the person I chose , gave you also the power to render handsome the man you should love , and on whom you were desirous to bestow that favour . &quot;
&quot; If such be the fact , &quot; said the Princess , &quot; I wish , with all my heart , that you should become the handsomest Prince in the world , and I bestow the gift on you to the <unk> extent in my power . &quot;
The Princess had no sooner pronounced these words , than Riquet with the Tuft appeared to her eyes , of all men in the world , the handsomest , the best made , and most amiable she had ever seen .
There are some who assert that it was not the spell of the Fairy , but love alone that caused this metamorphosis .
They say that the Princess , having reflected on the perseverance of her <unk> his prudence , and all the good qualities of his heart and mind , no longer saw the deformity of his body nor the ugliness of his <unk> his <unk> appeared to her nothing more than the effect of a man <unk> his shoulders , and that instead of observing , as she had done , that he <unk> horribly , she saw in him no more than a certain <unk> air , which charmed her .
They say also that his eyes , which <unk> , seemed to her only more brilliant from that defect , which passed in her mind for a proof of the intensity of his love , and , in fine , that his great red nose had in it something <unk> and heroic .
However this may be , the Princess promised on the spot to marry him , provided he obtained the consent of the King , her Father .
The King , having learned that his daughter entertained a great regard for Riquet with the Tuft , whom he knew also to be a very clever and wise prince , accepted him with pleasure for a son-in-law .
The wedding took place the next morning , as Riquet with the Tuft had foreseen , and , according to the instructions which he had given a long time before .
No beauty , no talent , has power above Some <unk> charm discern &apos;d only by love .

LITTLE THUMBLING .
Once upon a time there was a Woodcutter and his wife who had seven children , all boys ; the eldest was but ten years old , and the youngest only seven .
People wondered that the Woodcutter had had so many children in so short a time ; but the fact is , that his wife not only had them very fast , but seldom presented him with less than two at a birth .
They were very poor , and their seven children troubled them greatly , as not one of them was yet able to gain his livelihood .
What grieved them still more was that the youngest was very delicate , and seldom spoke , which they considered a proof of stupidity instead of good sense .
He was very diminutive , and , when first born , scarcely <unk> than one &apos;s <unk> , which caused them to call him Little Thumbling .
This poor child was the <unk> of the house , and was blamed for everything that happened .
Nevertheless he was the <unk> and most sensible of all his brothers , and if he spoke little , he listened a great deal .
There came a very bad <unk> , and the <unk> was so severe that these poor people determined to get rid of their children .
One evening , when they were all in bed , and the <unk> was sitting over the fire with his wife , he said to her , with an <unk> heart , &quot; Thou <unk> clearly that we can no longer find food for our children .
I cannot let them die of hunger before my eyes , and I am resolved to lose them to-morrow in the wood , which will be easily done , for whilst they are occupied in <unk> up the <unk> , we have but to make off <unk> by them . &quot;
&quot; Ah ! &quot;
exclaimed the Woodcutter &apos;s wife , &quot; <unk> thou have the heart to lose thine own children ? &quot;
Her husband in vain represented to her their exceeding poverty ; she could not consent to the deed .
She was poor , but she was their mother .
Having , however , reflected on the misery it would occasion her to see them die of hunger , she at length <unk> , and went to bed weeping .
Little Thumbling heard everything they had said , for having ascertained , as he lay in his bed , that they were talking of their affairs , he got up quietly , and slipped under his father &apos;s <unk> to listen , without being seen .
He went to bed again , and slept not a <unk> the rest of the night , thinking what he should do .
He rose early and repaired to the banks of a rivulet , where he filled his <unk> with small white pebbles , and then returned home .
They set out all together , and Little Thumbling said nothing of what he had heard to his brothers .
They entered a very thick forest , wherein , at ten paces distant , they could not see one another .
The Woodcutter began to cut wood , and his children to <unk> up <unk> to make <unk> with .
The father and mother , seeing them occupied with their work , stole away gradually , and then fled suddenly by a small <unk> path .
When the children found themselves all alone , they began to <unk> and cry with all their might .
Little Thumbling let them <unk> , well knowing how he could get home again , for as he came he had dropped all along the road the little white pebbles he had in his <unk> .
He said to them then , &quot; Fear nothing , brothers , my father and mother have left us here , but I will take you safely home , only follow me . &quot;
They followed him , and he led them back to the house by the same road that they had taken into the forest .
They feared to enter immediately , but placed themselves close to the door to listen to the conversation of their father and mother .
Just at the moment that the Woodcutter and his wife arrived at home , the lord of the <unk> sent them ten crowns which he had owed them a long time , and which they had given up all hope of receiving .
This was new life to them , for these poor people were actually <unk> .
The Woodcutter sent his wife to the <unk> &apos;s immediately .
As it was many a day since they had tasted meat , she bought three times as much as was necessary for the supper of two persons .
When they had satisfied their hunger , the Woodcutter &apos;s wife said , &quot; Alas !
where now are our poor children ; they would <unk> <unk> on what we have left .
But it was thou , <unk> , who wouldst lose them .
Truly did I say we should repent it .
What are they now doing in the forest !
Alas !
Heaven help me !
the wolves have , perhaps , already devoured them !
<unk> that thou art , thus to have destroyed thy children ! &quot;
The Woodcutter began to lose his temper , for she repeated more than twenty times that they should repent it , and that she had said they would .
He threatened to beat her if she did not hold her tongue .
It was not that the Woodcutter was not , perhaps , even more sorry than his wife , but that she made such a noise about it , and that he was like many other men who are very fond of women who can talk well , but are exceedingly annoyed by those whose words always come true .
The wife was all in tears .
&quot; Alas !
where are now my children , my poor children ? &quot;
She uttered this , at length , so loudly , that the children , who were at the door , heard her , and began to cry altogether , &quot; We are here !
we are here ! &quot;
She ran quickly to open the door to them , and , embracing them , exclaimed , &quot; How happy I am to see you again , my dear children ; you are very tired and hungry .
And how dirty thou art , <unk> ; come here and let me <unk> thee . &quot;
<unk> was her eldest son , and she loved him better than all the rest because he was rather <unk> , and she was slightly so herself .
They sat down to supper , and ate with an appetite that delighted their father and mother , to whom they related how frightened they were in the forest , speaking almost always all together .
The good folks were enchanted to see their children once more around them , and their joy lasted as long as the ten crowns ; but when the money was spent they <unk> into their former misery , and resolved to lose the children again , and to do so <unk> they determined to lead them much further from home than they had done the first time .
They could not talk of this so privately , but that they were overheard by Little Thumbling , who reckoned upon getting out of the <unk> by the same means as before ; but though he got up very early to collect the little pebbles , he could not succeed in his object , for he found the house door double locked .
He knew not what to do , when the Woodcutter &apos;s wife , having given them each a piece of bread for their breakfast , it occurred to him that he might make the bread <unk> the place of the pebbles by <unk> <unk> of it along the path as they went , and so he put his piece in his pocket .
The father and mother led them into the <unk> and <unk> part of the forest ; and as soon as they had done so , they gained a <unk> , and left them there .
Little Thumbling did not trouble himself much , for he believed he should easily find his way back by means of the bread which he had scattered wherever he had passed ; but he was greatly surprised at not being able to find a single <unk> .
The birds had eaten it all up !
Behold the poor children then , in great distress , for the further they wandered the <unk> they plunged into the forest .
Night came on , and a great wind arose , which terrified them horribly .
They fancied they heard on every side nothing but the <unk> of wolves , <unk> to devour them .
They scarcely dared to speak or look behind them .
It then began to <unk> so <unk> that they were soon <unk> to the skin ; they slipped at every step , <unk> into the <unk> , out of which they <unk> in a <unk> state , not knowing what to do with their hands .
Little Thumbling <unk> up a tree to try if he could see anything from the top of it .
Having looked all about him , he saw a little light like that of a <unk> , but it was a long way on the other side of the forest .
He came down again , and when he had reached the ground he could see the light no longer .
This distressed him greatly ; but having walked on with his brothers for some time in the direction of the light , he saw it again on <unk> from the wood .
At length they reached the house where the light was , not without many <unk> , for they often lost sight of it , and always when they descended into the <unk> .
They knocked loudly at the door , and a good woman came to open it .
She asked them what they wanted .
Little Thumbling told her they were poor children who had lost their way in the forest , and who begged a night &apos;s lodging for charity .
The woman , seeing they were all so pretty , began to weep , and said to them , &quot; Alas !
my poor children , whither have you come ?
<unk> that this is the dwelling of an Ogre who <unk> little boys ! &quot;
&quot; Alas , Madam ! &quot;
replied Little Thumbling , who trembled from head to foot , as did all his brothers ; &quot; what shall we do ? <unk> is certain that the wolves of the forest will not fail to devour us to-night , if you refuse to receive us under your roof , and that being the case , we had rather be eaten by the gentleman ; perhaps he may have pity upon us , if you are kind enough to ask him . &quot;
The Ogre &apos;s wife , who fancied she could contrive to hide them from her husband till the next morning , allowed them to come in , and led them where they could warm themselves by a good fire , for there was a whole sheep on the <unk> <unk> for the Ogre &apos;s supper .
Just as they were beginning to get warm , they heard two or three loud <unk> at the door .
It was the Ogre who had come home .
His wife immediately made the children hide under the bed , and went to open the door .
The Ogre first asked if his supper was ready and if she had drawn the wine , and with that he sat down to his meal .
The <unk> was all but raw , but he liked it all the better for that .
He <unk> right and left , saying that he <unk> fresh meat .
&quot; It must be the <unk> I have just skinned that you smell , &quot; said his wife .
&quot; I smell fresh meat , I tell you once more , &quot; replied the Ogre , looking <unk> at his wife ; &quot; there is something here that I don &apos;t understand . &quot;
In saying these words , he rose from the table and went straight to the <unk> &quot; Ah ! &quot;
he exclaimed , &quot; it is thus , then , thou wouldst deceive me , <unk> woman !
I know not what <unk> me from eating thee also !
It is well for thee that thou art an old beast !
Here is some game , which comes in good time for me to entertain three Ogres of my acquaintance who are coming to see me in a day or two . &quot;
He dragged them from under the bed one after the other .
The poor children fell on their knees , begging mercy ; but they had to deal with the most cruel of all the Ogres , and who , far from feeling pity for them , devoured them already with his eyes , and said to his wife they would be <unk> <unk> , when she had made a good sauce for them .
He went to fetch a great knife , and as he returned to the poor children , he <unk> it on a long stone that he held in his left hand .
He had already seized one , when his wife said to him , &quot; What would you do at this hour of the night ?
will it not be time enough to-morrow ? &quot;
&quot; Hold thy peace , &quot; replied the Ogre , &quot; they will be the more tender . &quot;
&quot; But you have already so much meat , &quot; returned his wife ; &quot; Here is a <unk> , two sheep , and half a <unk> . &quot;
&quot; Thou art right , &quot; said the Ogre ; &quot; give them a good supper , that they may not fall away , and then put them to bed . &quot;
The good woman was enchanted , and brought them plenty for supper , but they <unk> &apos;t eat , they were so <unk> with fright .
As for the Ogre , he seated himself to drink again , delighted to think he had such a treat in store for his friends .
He <unk> a dozen <unk> more than usual , which affected his head a little , and obliged him to go to bed .
The Ogre had seven daughters who were still in their infancy .
These little <unk> had the most beautiful <unk> , in consequence of their eating raw <unk> like their father ; but they had very small , round , grey eyes , <unk> noses , and very large <unk> , with long teeth , exceedingly sharp , and wide apart .
They were not very <unk> as yet ; but they promised <unk> to be so , for they already began to bite little children , in order to <unk> their blood .
They had been sent to bed early , and were all seven in a large bed , having each a crown of gold on her head .
In the same room was another bed of the same size .
It was in this bed that the Ogre &apos;s wife put the seven little boys to sleep , after which she went to sleep with her husband .
Little Thumbling , who had remarked that the Ogre &apos;s daughters had golden crowns on their heads , and who feared that the Ogre might regret that he had not killed him and his brothers that evening , got up in the middle of the night , and , taking off his own <unk> and those of his brothers , went very softly and placed them on the heads of the Ogre &apos;s seven daughters , after having taken off their golden crowns , which he put on his brothers and himself , in order that the Ogre might mistake them for his daughters , and his daughters for the boys whose throats he longed to cut .
<unk> turned out exactly as he anticipated , for the Ogre awaking at midnight , regretted having <unk> till the morning what he might have done the evening before .
He therefore jumped suddenly out of bed , and seizing his great knife , &quot; Let us go , &quot; said he , &quot; and see how our young <unk> are by this time ; we won &apos;t make two <unk> at a cherry . &quot;
<unk> he stole on <unk> up to his daughters &apos; <unk> , and approached the bed in which lay the little boys , who were all asleep except Thumbling , who was dreadfully frightened when the Ogre placed his hand upon his head to feel it , as he had in turn felt those of all his brothers .
The Ogre , who felt the golden crowns , said , &quot; Truly , I was about to do a pretty <unk> !
It &apos;s clear I must have drunk too much last night . &quot;
He then went to the bed where his daughters slept , and having felt the little <unk> that belonged to the boys .
&quot; <unk> ! &quot;
cried he .
&quot; Here are our young <unk> !
Let us to work boldly ! &quot;
So saying , he cut without hesitation the throats of his seven daughters .
Well satisfied with this <unk> , he returned and stretched himself beside his wife .
As soon as Little Thumbling heard the Ogre <unk> , he woke his brothers , and bade them dress themselves quickly and follow him .
They went down softly into the garden and jumped over the <unk> .
They ran nearly all night long , trembling all the way , and not knowing whither they were going .
The Ogre , awaking in the morning , said to his wife , &quot; <unk> thee up stairs and dress the little <unk> you took in last night . &quot;
The Ogress was astonished at the kindness of her husband , never <unk> the sort of <unk> he meant her to give them , and <unk> he ordered her to go and put on their clothes ; she went up stairs , where she was greatly surprised to find her daughters murdered and <unk> in their blood .
The first thing she did was to faint ( for it is the first thing that almost all women do in similar circumstances ) .
The Ogre , fearing that his wife would be too long about the <unk> he had given her to do , went upstairs to help her .
He was not less surprised than his wife , when he beheld this frightful spectacle .
&quot; <unk> !
what have I done ? &quot;
he exclaimed .
&quot; The wretches shall pay for it , and instantly ! &quot;
He then threw a <unk> of water in his wife &apos;s face , and having brought her to , said , &quot; <unk> !
give me my seven-league boots , that I may go and catch them . &quot;
He set out , and after running in every direction , came at last upon the <unk> of the poor children , who were not more than a hundred <unk> from their father &apos;s house .
They saw the Ogre <unk> from <unk> to <unk> , and who stepped over <unk> as easily as if they were the smallest <unk> .
Little Thumbling , who perceived a hollow rock close by where they were , hid his brothers in it , and <unk> in after them , watching all the while the progress of the Ogre .
The Ogre , feeling very tired with his long journey to no purpose ( for seven-league boots are very fatiguing to the wearer ) , was inclined to rest , and by chance sat down on the very rock in which the little boys had concealed themselves .
As he was quite worn out , he had not rested long before he fell asleep , and began to <unk> so dreadfully that the poor children were not less frightened than they were when he took up the great knife to cut their throats .
Little Thumbling was not so much alarmed , and told his brothers to run quickly into the house while the Ogre was sound asleep , and not to be uneasy about him .
They took his advice and speedily reached home .
Little Thumbling having approached the Ogre , gently pulled off his boots , and put them on directly .
The boots were very large and very long ; but as they were fairy boots , they possessed the quality of increasing or <unk> in size according to the <unk> of the person who wore them , so that they fitted him as perfectly as if they had been made for him .
He went straight to the Ogre &apos;s house , where he found his wife weeping over her murdered daughters .
&quot; Your husband , &quot; said Little Thumbling to her , &quot; is in great danger , for he has been seized by a band of <unk> , who have <unk> to kill him if he does not give them all his gold and silver .
At the moment they had their <unk> at his throat he perceived me , and entreated me to come and tell you the situation he was in , and bid you give me all his ready <unk> , without keeping back any of it , as otherwise they will kill him without mercy .
As time pressed , he insisted I should take his seven-league boots , which you see I have on , in order that I might make haste , and also that you might be sure I was not <unk> upon you . &quot;
The good woman , very much alarmed , immediately gave him all the money she could find , for the Ogre was not a bad husband to her , although he ate little children .
Little Thumbling , thus laden with all the wealth of the Ogre , hastened back to his father &apos;s house , where he was received with great joy .
There are many persons who differ in their account of this part of the story , and who pretend that Little Thumbling never committed this <unk> , and that he only considered himself justified in taking the Ogre &apos;s seven-league boots , because he used them expressly to run after little children .
These people assert that they have heard it from good authority , and that they have even eaten and drunk in the Woodcutter &apos;s house .
They assure us that when Little Thumbling had put on the Ogre &apos;s boots , he went to Court , where he knew they were in much trouble about an army which was within two hundred leagues of them , and anxious to learn the success of a battle that had been fought .
They say he went to seek the King , and told him that if he desired it , he would bring him back news of the army before the end of the day .
The King promised him a large sum of money if he did so .
Little Thumbling brought news that very evening , and this first journey having made him known , he got whatever he chose to ask ; for the King paid most <unk> for taking his orders to the army , and numberless ladies gave him anything he chose for news of their lovers , and they were his best <unk> .
He occasionally met with some wives who entrusted him with letters for their husbands , but they paid him so <unk> , and the amount was altogether so trifling , that he did not condescend to put down amongst his receipts what he got for that service .
After he had been a courier for some time , and saved a great deal of money , he returned to his father , where it is impossible to imagine the joy of his family at seeing him again .
He made them all comfortable .
He bought <unk> offices for his father and his brothers , and by these means established them all , making his own way at Court at the same time .
<unk> is the handsome boy <unk> , alone , his father &apos;s joy ; While the tiny , timid child Is neglected or <unk> .
Notwithstanding , sometimes he <unk> , of all , the <unk> to be .
THE <unk> DE <unk> .
PERFECT LOVE .
In one of those agreeable countries subject to the Empire of the Fairies , reigned the redoubtable Danamo .
She was learned in her art , cruel in her <unk> , and proud of the honour of being descended from the celebrated <unk> , whose charms had the glory and the power , by <unk> the famous Ulysses , to triumph over the prudence of the <unk> of <unk> .
She was tall , <unk> , and her haughty spirit had with much difficulty been subjected to the rigid laws of Hymen .
Love had never been able to reach her heart , but the idea of uniting a <unk> kingdom to that of which she was Queen , and another which she had <unk> , had induced her to marry an old monarch , who was one of her neighbours .
He died a few years after his marriage , and left the Queen with one daughter , named Azire .
She was exceedingly ugly , but did not appear so in the eyes of Danamo , who thought her charming , perhaps because she was the very image of herself .
She was heiress also to three kingdoms , a circumstance which softened down many defects , and her hand was sought in marriage by all the most powerful princes of the adjacent provinces .
Their eagerness , joined to the blind affection of Danamo , rendered her vanity insupportable .
She was ardently <unk> must , therefore , be worthy of such <unk> .
It was thus that the Fairy and the Princess <unk> in their own minds , and enjoyed the pleasure of <unk> themselves .
Meanwhile , Danamo thought only of rendering the happiness of the Princess as perfect as she considered was her due , and , with this object , brought up in her palace a young Prince , the son of her brother .
His name was Parcin Parcinet .
He had a noble bearing , a graceful figure , a profusion of beautiful fair hair .
Love might have been jealous of his power , for that deity had never , amongst his <unk> arrows , any so certain to triumph <unk> over hearts as the fine eyes of Parcin Parcinet .
He could do everything well that he chose to <unk> and sang to perfection , and bore off all the <unk> in the tournament whenever he took the trouble to contend for them .
This young Prince was the delight of the Court , and Danamo , who had her motives for it , made no <unk> to the homage and admiration which he received .
The King who was the father of Parcinet was the Fairy &apos;s brother .
She declared war against him without even seeking for a reason .
The King fought <unk> , at the head of his troops ; but what could any army effect against the power of so skilful a Fairy as Danamo ?
She allowed the victory to remain in doubt only long enough for her unfortunate brother to fall in the combat .
As soon as he was dead , she dispersed all her enemies with one stroke of her wand , and made herself mistress of the kingdom .
Parcin Parcinet was at that time still in his cradle .
They brought him to Danamo .
It would have been in vain to attempt hiding him from a Fairy .
He already displayed those <unk> graces which win the heart .
Danamo caressed him , and a few days afterwards took him with her to her own dominions .
The Prince had attained the age of eighteen , when the Fairy , desirous at length of executing the designs which she had so many years contemplated , resolved to marry Parcin Parcinet to the Princess , her daughter .
She never for a moment doubted the infinite delight which that young Prince , born to a throne , and condemned by misfortune to remain a subject , would feel at becoming in one day the sovereign of three kingdoms .
She sent for the Princess , and revealed to her the choice she had made of a husband for her .
The Princess listened to this <unk> with an emotion which caused the Fairy to believe that this resolution in favour of Parcin Parcinet was not agreeable to her daughter .
&quot; I see clearly , &quot; she said to her , as she perceived her agitation increasing , &quot; that thou hast much more ambition , and wouldst unite with thine own empire that of one of those kings who have so often proposed for thee ; but where is the King whom Parcin Parcinet cannot conquer ?
In courage he surpasses them all .
The subjects of so perfect a prince might one day <unk> in his favour .
In giving thee to him I secure to thee the possession of his kingdom .
As to his person , it is unnecessary to <unk> <unk> that the proudest beauties have not been able to resist his charms . &quot;
The Princess , suddenly flinging herself at the feet of the Fairy , interrupted her discourse , and confessed to her that her heart had not been able to defy the young victor , famous for so many conquests .
&quot; But , &quot; added she , blushing , &quot; I have given a thousand proofs of my affection to the insensible Parcin Parcinet , and he has received them with a coldness which <unk> me . &quot;
&quot; &apos; <unk> because he <unk> not raise his thoughts so high as thee , &quot; replied the haughty Fairy .
&quot; He fears , no doubt , to offend me , and I appreciate his respect . &quot;
This flattering idea was too agreeable to the inclination and the vanity of the Princess for her not to be persuaded of its truth .
The Fairy ended by sending for Parcin Parcinet .
He came , and found her in a magnificent cabinet , where she awaited him with the Princess , her daughter .
&quot; <unk> all thy courage to thy assistance , &quot; said she to him as soon as he <unk> &quot; not to support affliction , but to prevent being overcome by thy good fortune .
Thou art called to a throne , Parcin Parcinet , and to crown thy happiness , thou wilt mount that throne by espousing my daughter . &quot;
&quot; I , Madam ! &quot;
exclaimed the young Prince , with an astonishment in which it was easy to perceive that joy had no share , &quot; I <unk> the Princess , &quot; continued he , retreating a few paces .
&quot; <unk> !
what deity is <unk> with my fate ?
Why does he not leave the care of it to the only one from whom I implore assistance ? &quot;
These words were uttered by the Prince with a <unk> in which his heart took too much part to allow it to be controlled by his prudence .
The Fairy imagined that the <unk> happiness had driven Parcin Parcinet out of his wits ; but the Princess loved him , and love sometimes renders lovers more keen <unk> than even wisdom .
&quot; From what deity , Parcin Parcinet , &quot; said she to him with emotion , &quot; do you implore assistance so fondly ?
I feel too deeply that I have no share in the prayers you address to him . &quot;
The young Prince , who had had time to recover from his first surprise , and who was <unk> of the imprudence he had committed , summoned his brain to the assistance of his heart .
He answered the Princess with more <unk> than she had hoped for , and thanked the Fairy with an air of dignity that sufficiently proved him to be worthy not only of the empire that was offered him , but of that of the whole world .
Danamo and her proud daughter were satisfied with his expressions , and they settled everything before they left the apartment , the Fairy <unk> the <unk> a short time , only to give opportunity to all her Court to prepare for this grand <unk> .
The news of the marriage of Parcin Parcinet and Azire was spread throughout the Palace the moment they had quitted the Queen &apos;s cabinet .
<unk> came to <unk> the Prince .
However <unk> the Princess , it was to high fortune she conducted him .
Parcin Parcinet received all these honours with an air of indifference , which surprised his new subjects the more , for that they <unk> beneath it extreme affliction and anxiety .
He was compelled , however , to endure for the rest of the day the eager homage of the whole Court , and the <unk> demonstrations of affection lavished upon him by Azire .
What a situation for a young Prince , a prey to the keenest anguish .
Night seemed to him to have delayed its return a thousand times longer than usual .
The impatient Parcin Parcinet prayed for its arrival .
It came at length .
He quitted precipitately the place in which he had suffered so much .
He retired to his own apartments , and , having dismissed his attendants , opened a door which led into the Palace <unk> , and hurried through them , followed only by a young slave .
A beautiful , but not very <unk> , river ran at the end of the gardens , and separated from the magnificent Palace of the Fairy a little Château , <unk> by four towers , and surrounded by a <unk> deep <unk> , which was filled by the river aforesaid .
It was to this fatal spot that the vows and sighs of Parcin Parcinet were incessantly wafted .
What a miracle was confined in it !
Danamo had the treasure carefully guarded within it .
It was a young Princess , the daughter of her sister , who , dying , had confided her to the charge of the Fairy .
Her beauty , worthy the admiration of the universe , appeared too dangerous to Danamo to allow her to be seen by the side of Azire .
<unk> was occasionally accorded to the charming Irolite ( so was she named ) , to come to the Palace , to visit the Fairy and the Princess her daughter , but she had never been allowed to appear in public .
Her dawning beauties were unknown to the world , but there was one who was not ignorant of them .
They had met the eyes of Parcin Parcinet one day at the apartments of the Princess Azire , and he had adored Irolite from the moment that he had seen her .
Their near relationship afforded no privilege to that young Prince ; from the time Irolite ceased to be an infant the pitiless Danamo suffered no one to behold her .
Nevertheless Parcin Parcinet burned with a flame as ardent as such charms as Irolite &apos;s could not fail to <unk> .
She was just <unk> .
Her beauty was perfect .
Her hair was of a charming colour .
Without being decidedly dark or fair , her complexion had all the <unk> of spring .
Her mouth was lovely , her teeth admirable , her smile <unk> .
She had large <unk> eyes , sparkling and tender , and her glances appeared to say a thousand things which her young heart was ignorant of .
She had been brought up in complete solitude .
Near as was the Palace of the Fairy to the Château in which she <unk> , she saw no more persons than she might have seen in the midst of deserts .
Danamo &apos;s orders to this effect were strictly followed .
The lovely Irolite passed her days amongst the women appointed to attend her .
They were few in number , but little as were the advantages to be gained in so solitary and <unk> a Court , Fame , which feared not Danamo , published such wonders of this young Princess , that ladies of the highest rank were eager to share the seclusion of the youthful Irolite .
Her appearance confirmed all that Fame had reported .
They were always finding some new charm to admire in her .
A governess of great intelligence and prudence , formerly attached to the Princess who was the mother of Irolite , had been allowed to remain with her , and frequently <unk> the <unk> conduct of Danamo towards her young mistress .
Her name was Mana .
Her desire to restore the Princess to the liberty she was entitled to enjoy , and the position she was born to occupy , had induced her to favour the love of Parcin Parcinet .
It was now three years since he had contrived to <unk> himself one evening into the Château in the dress of a slave .
He found Irolite in the garden , and declared his passion for her .
She was then but a charming child .
She loved Parcin Parcinet as if he had been her brother , and could not then comprehend the existence of any <unk> attachment .
Mana , who was rarely absent from the side of Irolite , surprised the young Prince in the garden ; he <unk> to her his love for the Princess , and the determination he had formed to perish , or to restore her one day to liberty , and then to seek , by a personal appeal to his former subjects , a glorious means of revenging himself on Danamo , and of placing Irolite upon the throne .
The noble qualities which were daily developed in the nature of Parcin Parcinet , might have rendered probable his success in still more difficult <unk> , and it was also the only hope of rescue which offered itself to Irolite .
Mana allowed him to visit the Château occasionally after nightfall .
He saw Irolite only in her presence , but he spoke to her of his love , and never ceased endeavouring , by tender words and devoted attentions , to inspire her with a passion as ardent as his own .
For three years Parcin Parcinet had been occupied solely with this passion .
<unk> every night he visited the Château of his Princess , and all his days he passed in thinking of her .
We left him on his road through Danamo &apos;s gardens , followed by a slave , and absorbed in the despair to which the determination of the Fairy had reduced him .
He reached the river &apos;s bank : a little <unk> boat , <unk> to the shore , in which Azire sometimes enjoyed an <unk> on the water , enabled the enamoured Prince to cross the stream .
The slave rowed him over , and as soon as Parcin Parcinet had ascended the silken ladder which was thrown to him from a little terrace that extended along the entire front of the Château , the faithful servant rowed the boat back to its <unk> , and remained with it there until a signal was made to him by his master .
This was the <unk> , for a few minutes , of a lighted <unk> on the terrace .
This evening the Prince took his usual route , the silken ladder was thrown to him , and he reached , without any obstacle , the apartment of the youthful Irolite .
He found her stretched on a couch , and bathed in tears .
How beautiful did she appear to him in her affliction .
Her charms had never before affected the young Prince so deeply .
&quot; What is the matter , my Princess ? &quot;
asked he , flinging himself on his knees before the couch on which she lay .
&quot; What can have caused these precious tears to <unk> ?
Alas ! &quot;
he continued , sighing , &quot; have I still more misfortunes to learn here ? &quot;
The young lovers mingled their tears and sighs , and were forced to give full vent to their sorrow before they could find words to declare its cause .
At length the young Prince entreated Irolite to tell him what new severity the Fairy had treated her with .
&quot; She would compel you to marry Azire , &quot; replied the beautiful Irolite , blushing ; &quot; which of all her cruelties could cause me so much agony ? &quot;
&quot; Ah !
my dear Princess , &quot; exclaimed the Prince , &quot; you fear I shall marry Azire !
My lot is a thousand times more happy than I could have imagined it ! &quot;
&quot; Can you <unk> in your destiny , &quot; sadly rejoined the Princess , &quot; when it threatens to separate us ?
I cannot express to you the tortures that I suffer from this fear !
Ah , Parcin Parcinet , you were right !
The love I bear to you is far different from that I should feel for a brother ! &quot;
