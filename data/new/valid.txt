<unk> everything , and go everywhere except into that little closet , which I forbid you to enter , and I forbid you so strictly , that if you should venture to open the door , there is nothing that you may not have to dread from my anger ! &quot;
She promised to observe <unk> all his directions , and after he had embraced her , he got into his coach and set out on his journey .
The neighbours and friends of the young bride did not wait for her invitation , so eager were they to see all the treasures contained in the mansion , not having ventured to enter it while the husband was at home , so terrified were they at his blue beard .
Behold them immediately running through all the rooms , <unk> , and <unk> , each apartment exceeding the other in beauty and richness .
They ascended afterwards to the <unk> , where they could not sufficiently admire the number and <unk> of the <unk> , the beds , the <unk> , the cabinets , the stands , &#91; 1 &#93; the <unk> , and the mirrors in which they could see themselves from head to foot , and that had <unk> some of glass , &#91; 2 &#93; some of silver , and some of gilt metal , more beautiful and magnificent than had ever been seen .
They never ceased <unk> upon and <unk> the good fortune of their friend , who in the meanwhile was not in the least entertained by the sight of all these treasures , in consequence of her impatience to open the closet on the ground floor .
Her curiosity increased to such a degree that , without reflecting how rude it was to leave her company , she ran down a back staircase in such haste that twice or <unk> she narrowly escaped breaking her neck .
<unk> at the door of the closet , she paused for a moment , <unk> herself of her husband &apos;s prohibition , and that some misfortune might <unk> her for her <unk> ; but the <unk> was so strong that she could not conquer it .
She therefore took the little key and opened , tremblingly , the door of the closet .
At first she could discern nothing , the windows being closed ; after a short time she began to perceive that the floor was all covered with <unk> blood , in which were reflected the dead <unk> of several females suspended against the walls .
These were all the wives of Blue Beard , who had cut their throats one after the other .
She was ready to die with fright , and the key of the closet , which she had withdrawn from the lock , fell from her hand .
After recovering her senses a little , she picked up the key , locked the door again , and went up to her chamber to compose herself ; but she could not succeed , so greatly was she agitated .
Having observed that the key of the closet was <unk> with blood , she <unk> it two or three times , but the blood would not come off .
In vain she <unk> it , and even <unk> it with sand and <unk> , the blood was still there , for the key was enchanted , and there were no means of <unk> it completely : when the blood was <unk> off one side , it came back on the other .
Blue Beard returned that very evening , and said that he had received letters on the road informing him that the business on which he was going had been settled to his advantage .
His wife did all she could to persuade him that she was delighted at his speedy return .
The next morning he asked her for his keys again ; she gave them to him ; but her hand trembled so , that he had not much difficulty in <unk> what had occurred .
&quot; How comes it , &quot; said he , &quot; that the key of the closet is not with the others ? &quot;
&quot; I must have left it , &quot; she replied , &quot; upstairs on my table . &quot;
&quot; <unk> not , &quot; said Blue Beard , &quot; to give it me <unk> . &quot;
After several <unk> , she was compelled to produce the key .
Blue Beard having examined it , said to his wife , &quot; Why is there some blood on this key ? &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know , &quot; answered the poor wife , <unk> than death .
&quot; You don &apos;t know ? &quot;
rejoined Blue Beard .
&quot; I know well enough .
You must needs enter the closet .
Well , madam , you shall enter it , and go take your place amongst the ladies you saw there . &quot;
She flung herself at her husband &apos;s feet , weeping and begging his pardon , with all the signs of true repentance for having disobeyed him .
Her beauty and affliction might have <unk> a rock , but Blue Beard had a heart <unk> than a rock .
&quot; You must die , madam , &quot; said he , &quot; and immediately . &quot;
&quot; If I must die , &quot; she replied , looking at him with <unk> eyes , &quot; give me a little time to say my prayers . &quot;
&quot; I give you half a quarter of an hour , &quot; answered Blue Beard , &quot; but not a minute more . &quot;
As soon as he had left her , she called her sister , and said to her , &quot; Sister Anne &quot; ( for so she was named ) , &quot; go up , I pray thee , to the top of the tower , and see if my brothers are not coming .
They have promised me that they would come to see me to-day ; and if you see them , sign to them to make haste . &quot;
Sister Anne mounted to the top of the tower , and the poor distressed creature called to her every now and then , &quot; Anne !
sister Anne !
dost thou not see anything coming ? &quot;
And sister Anne answered her , &quot; I see nothing but the sun making dust , and the grass growing green . &quot;
In the meanwhile Blue Beard , with a great <unk> in his hand , called out with all his might to his wife , &quot; Come down quickly , or I will come up there . &quot;
&quot; One minute more , if you please , &quot; replied his wife ; and immediately repeated in a low voice , &quot; Anne !
sister Anne !
dost thou not see anything coming ? &quot;
And sister Anne replied , &quot; I see nothing but the sun making dust , and the grass growing green . &quot;
&quot; Come down quickly , &quot; <unk> Blue Beard , &quot; or I will come up there . &quot;
&quot; I come , &quot; answered his wife , and then exclaimed , &quot; Anne !
sister Anne !
dost thou not see anything coming ? &quot;
&quot; I see , &quot; said sister Anne , &quot; a great cloud of dust <unk> this way . &quot;
&quot; Is it my brothers ? &quot;
&quot; Alas !
no , sister , I see a flock of sheep . &quot;
&quot; <unk> thou not come down ? &quot;
<unk> Blue Beard .
&quot; One minute more , &quot; replied his wife , and then she cried , &quot; Anne !
sister Anne !
dost thou not see anything coming ? &quot;
&quot; I see , &quot; she replied , &quot; two <unk> coming this way ; but they are still at a great distance . &quot;
&quot; Heaven be praised ! &quot;
she exclaimed , a moment afterwards .
&quot; They are my brothers !
I am making all the signs I can to hasten them . &quot;
Blue Beard began to roar so loudly that the whole house shook again .
The poor wife descended , and went and threw herself , with <unk> eyes and <unk> <unk> , at his feet .
&quot; It is of no use , &quot; said Blue Beard .
&quot; You must die ! &quot;
Then seizing her by the hair with one hand , and raising his <unk> with the other , he was about to cut off her head .
The poor wife turned towards him , and fixing upon him her dying eyes , implored him to allow her one short moment to collect herself .
&quot; No , no , &quot; said he ; &quot; recommend thyself heartily to Heaven . &quot;
And <unk> his <unk> At this moment there was so loud a knocking at the gate , that Blue Beard stopped short .
It was opened , and two <unk> were immediately seen to enter , who , drawing their swords , ran straight at Blue Beard .
He recognised them as the brothers of his <unk> a <unk> , the other a <unk> , and , consequently , fled immediately , in hope to escape ; but they pursued him so closely , that they <unk> him before he could reach the step of his door , and , passing their swords through his body , left him dead on the spot .
The poor wife was almost as dead as her husband , and had not strength to rise and embrace her brothers .
It was found that Blue Beard had no <unk> , and so his widow remained possessed of all his property .
She employed part of it in marrying her sister Anne to a young gentleman who had long loved her ; another part , in <unk> captains &apos; commissions for her two brothers , and with the rest she married herself to a very worthy man , who made her forget the miserable time she had passed with Blue Beard .
<unk> one has common sense , And of the world but knows the ways , This story bears the evidence Of being one of <unk> days .
No husband now is so terrific , <unk> , expecting : <unk> jealous , he is still <unk> , <unk> to his wife affecting .
And of his beard , <unk> &apos;er the hue , His <unk> need fear no such disaster .
<unk> , &apos; twould often <unk> you To say which of the <unk> is master .
FOOTNOTES : &#91; 1 &#93; <unk> , _ i.e. _ , stands to place <unk> or <unk> upon .
The word is now used to signify any small round table with one foot ; but the <unk> stand , which was higher than a table , and its top not <unk> than a <unk> plate , is occasionally to be met with .
&#91; 2 &#93; <unk> with <unk> of the same material were much in <unk> at that period .
Of <unk> mirrors some magnificent <unk> remain to us at <unk> Park , <unk> .
THE SLEEPING BEAUTY IN THE WOOD .
Once upon a time there was a King and a Queen , who were so vexed at not having any <unk> vexed , that one cannot express it .
They visited all the baths in the world .
<unk> , <unk> , everything was tried , and nothing succeeded .
At length , however , the Queen was brought to bed of a daughter .
There was a splendid <unk> .
For <unk> they gave the young Princess all the Fairies they could find in the country ( they found seven ) , in order that each making her a gift , according to the custom of Fairies in those days , the Princess would , by these means , become possessed of all imaginable perfections .
After the <unk> ceremonies all the company returned to the King &apos;s palace , where a great banquet was set out for the Fairies .
<unk> were laid for each , consisting of a magnificent plate , with a <unk> gold case , containing a <unk> , a <unk> , and a knife of fine gold , enriched with diamonds and rubies .
But as they were all taking their places at the table , there was seen to enter an old Fairy , who had not been invited , because for upwards of fifty years she had never quitted the tower she resided in , and it was supposed she was either dead or enchanted .
The King ordered a cover to be laid for her ; but there was no <unk> of giving her a <unk> gold case such as the others had , because there had been only seven made expressly for the seven Fairies .
The old lady thought she was treated with contempt , and <unk> some threats between her teeth .
One of the young Fairies , who <unk> to be near her , overheard her , and imagining she might cast some misfortune on the little Princess , went , as soon as they rose from table , and hid herself behind the hangings , in order to have the last word , and be able to repair , as fast as possible , any mischief the old woman might do .
In the meanwhile , the Fairies began to endow the Princess .
The youngest , as her gift , decreed that she should be the most beautiful person in the world ; the next Fairy , that she should have the mind of an <unk> ; the third , that she should evince the most admirable grace in all she did ; the fourth , that she should dance to perfection ; the fifth , that she should sing like a <unk> ; and the sixth , that she should play on every instrument in the most exquisite manner possible .
The turn of the old Fairy having arrived , she declared , while her head shook more with <unk> than with age , that the Princess should pierce her hand with a spindle , and die of the wound .
This terrible fate made all the company tremble , and there was not one of them who could refrain from tears .
At this moment the young Fairy issued from behind the <unk> , and uttered aloud these words : &quot; <unk> yourselves , King and <unk> daughter shall not die of it .
It is true that I have not sufficient power to <unk> entirely what my elder has done .
The Princess will pierce her hand with a spindle ; but , instead of dying , she will only fall into a deep slumber , which will last one hundred years , at the end of which a King &apos;s son will come to wake her . &quot;
The King , in hope of avoiding the misfortune predicted by the old Fairy , immediately caused an <unk> to be published , by which he forbade any one to spin with a spindle , or to have <unk> in their possession , under pain of death .
At the end of fifteen or sixteen years , the King and Queen , being absent at one of their country <unk> , it happened that the Princess , while running one day about the castle , and from one chamber up to another , arrived at the top of a tower , and entered a little <unk> , where an honest old woman was sitting by herself , spinning with her distaff and spindle .
This good woman had never heard of the King &apos;s prohibition with respect to spinning with a spindle .
&quot; What are you doing there ? &quot;
asked the Princess .
&quot; I am spinning , my fair child , &quot; answered the old woman , who did not know her .
&quot; Oh , how pretty it is ! &quot;
rejoined the Princess .
&quot; How do you do it ?
Give it to me , that I may see if I can do it as well . &quot;
She had no sooner taken hold of the spindle , than , being very hasty , a little <unk> , and , moreover , the sentence of the Fairies so <unk> it , she pierced her hand with the point of it , and fainted away .
The good old woman , greatly embarrassed , called for help .
People came from all quarters ; they threw water in the Princess &apos;s face ; they <unk> her <unk> ; they <unk> her hands ; they <unk> her temples with Queen of Hungary &apos;s water , &#91; 3 &#93; but nothing could bring her to .
The King , who had run upstairs at the noise , then remembered the prediction of the Fairies , and , wisely concluding that this must have occurred as the Fairies said it would , had the Princess conveyed into the finest apartment in the palace , and placed on a bed of gold and silver embroidery .
One would have said she was an <unk> , so lovely did she <unk> her swoon had not deprived her of her rich complexion : her cheeks preserved their crimson , and her lips were like coral .
Her eyes were closed , but they could hear her breathe softly , which showed that she was not dead .
The King commanded them to let her repose in peace until the hour arrived for her waking .
The good Fairy who had saved her life , by <unk> that she should sleep for an hundred years , was in the Kingdom of <unk> , twelve thousand leagues off , when the Princess met with her accident ; but she was informed of it instantly by a little dwarf , who had a pair of seven-league boots ( that is , boots which enabled the wearer to take seven leagues at a <unk> &#91; 4 &#93; ) .
The Fairy set out immediately and an hour afterwards they saw her arrive in a fiery chariot , drawn by dragons .
The King advanced , to hand her out of the chariot .
She approved of all he had done ; but , as she had great <unk> , she considered that , when the Princess awoke , she would feel considerably embarrassed at finding herself all alone in that old castle ; so this is what the Fairy did .
She touched with her wand everybody that was in the castle ( except the King and Queen ) : <unk> , <unk> of honour , women of the bed-chamber , gentlemen , officers , <unk> , cooks , <unk> , boys , guards , <unk> , pages , footmen ; she touched also the horses that were in the <unk> , with their <unk> , the great <unk> in the court-yard , and little <unk> , the tiny dog of the Princess , that was on the bed , beside her .
As soon as she had touched them , they all fell asleep , not to wake again until the time arrived for their mistress to do so , in order that they might be all ready to attend upon her when she should want them .
Even the <unk> that had been put down to the fire , laden with partridges and <unk> , went to sleep , and the fire itself also .
All this was done in a moment ; the fairies never lost much time over their work .
After which , the King and Queen , having kissed their dear daughter without waking her , quitted the Castle , and issued a <unk> <unk> any person , <unk> , to approach it .
These orders were unnecessary , for in a quarter of an hour there grew up around the Park so great a quantity of trees , large and small , of brambles and thorns , <unk> each other , that neither man nor beast could get through them , so that nothing more was to be seen than the <unk> of the Castle <unk> , and they only at a considerable distance .
Nobody doubted but that was also some of the Fairy &apos;s <unk> , in order that the Princess might have nothing to fear from the curiosity of strangers during her slumber .
At the <unk> of an hundred years , the son of the King at that time upon the throne , and who was of a different family to that of the sleeping Princess , having been hunting in that neighbourhood , inquired what towers they were that he saw above the trees of a very thick wood .
Each person answered him according to the story he had heard .
Some said that it was an old castle , <unk> by <unk> .
<unk> , that all the <unk> of those parts held their <unk> in it .
The more general opinion was , that it was the abode of an <unk> ; and that he carried thither all the children he could catch , in order to eat them at his leisure , and without being pursued , having alone the power of making his way through the wood .
The Prince did not know what to believe about it , when an old peasant spoke in his turn , and said to him , &quot; Prince , it is more than fifty years ago since I heard my father say that there was in that Castle the most beautiful Princess that was ever seen .
That she was to sleep for a hundred years , and would be awakened by a King &apos;s son for whom she was reserved . &quot;
The young Prince , at these words , felt himself all on fire .
He believed , without hesitation , that he was destined to accomplish this famous adventure ; and , impelled by love and glory , resolved to see what would come of it , upon the spot .
Scarcely had he approached the wood , when all those great trees , all those brambles and thorns made way for him to pass of their own accord .
He walked towards the Castle , which he saw at the end of a long avenue he had entered , and what rather surprised him was , that he found none of his people had been able to follow him , the trees having closed up again as soon as he had passed .
He continued , nevertheless , to advance ; a young and amorous prince is always courageous .
He entered a large <unk> , where everything he saw was calculated to <unk> his blood with terror .
A frightful silence reigned around .
<unk> seemed everywhere present .
Nothing was to be seen but the <unk> of men and animals stretched out apparently <unk> .
He soon discovered , however , by the shining noses and red faces of the <unk> , that they were only asleep ; and their <unk> , in which still remained a few drops of wine , sufficiently proved that they had <unk> off whilst drinking .
He passed through a large court-yard <unk> with marble ; he ascended the staircase .
He entered the <unk> , where the guards stood drawn up in line , their <unk> <unk> , and <unk> their <unk> .
He traversed several apartments , with ladies and gentlemen all asleep ; some standing , others seated .
He entered a chamber covered with gold , and saw on a bed , the curtains of which were open on each side , the most lovely sight he had ever looked <unk> Princess , who seemed to be about fifteen or sixteen , the lustre of whose charms gave her an appearance that was <unk> and supernatural .
He approached , trembling and admiring , and knelt down beside her .
At that moment , the enchantment being ended , the Princess awoke , and gazing upon the Prince with more tenderness than a first sight of him seemed to <unk> , &quot; Is it you , Prince ? &quot;
said she ; &quot; you have been long awaited . &quot;
The Prince , delighted at these words , and still more by the tone in which they were uttered , knew not how to express to her his joy and gratitude .
&#91; Illustration : The <unk> <unk>
12 . &#93;
He assured her he loved her better than himself .
His language was not very <unk> , but it pleased the more .
There was little eloquence , but a great deal of love .
He was much more embarrassed than she was , and one ought not to be astonished at that .
The Princess had had time enough to consider what she should say to him , for there is reason to believe ( though history makes no mention of it ) that , during her long <unk> , the good Fairy had procured her the pleasure of very agreeable dreams .
In short , they talked for four hours without having said half what they had to say to each other .
In the meanwhile , all the Palace had been roused at the same time as the Princess .
Everybody remembered their duty , and , as they were not all in love , they were dying with hunger .
The <unk> , as hungry as any of them , became impatient , and announced loudly to the Princess that the meat was on the table .
The Prince assisted the Princess to rise ; she was full dressed , and most magnificently , but he took good care not to hint to her that she was attired like his <unk> , and wore a <unk> collar .
&#91; 5 &#93; She looked , however , not a morsel the less lovely in it .
They passed into a hall of mirrors , in which they supped , attended by the officers of the Princess .
The <unk> and <unk> played old but excellent pieces of music , notwithstanding it was a hundred years since they had been performed by anybody ; and after supper , to lose no time , the grand <unk> married the royal lovers in the <unk> of the Castle .
Early next morning the Prince returned to the city , where his father was in great anxiety about him .
The Prince told him that he had lost himself in the forest whilst hunting , and that he had slept in a <unk> &apos;s hut , who had given him some black bread and cheese for his supper .
The King , his father , who was a simple man , believed him , but his mother was not so easily satisfied ; and observing that he went hunting nearly every day , and had always some story ready as an excuse , when he had slept two or three nights away from home , she no longer doubted but that he had some mistress , for he lived with the Princess for upwards of two years , and had two children by her ; the first , which was a girl , was named Aurora , and the second , a son , was called Day , because he was still more beautiful than his sister .
The Queen often said to her son , in order to draw from him some avowal , that he ought to form some attachment ; but he never ventured to trust her with his secret .
He feared her , although he loved her , for she was of the race of Ogres , and the King had married her only on account of her great wealth .
It was even <unk> about the Court that she had the inclinations of an Ogress , and that when she saw little children passing , she had the greatest difficulty in <unk> herself from <unk> upon them .
The Prince , therefore , would never say one word about his adventure .
On the death of the King , however , which happened two years afterwards , the Prince being his own master , he made a public declaration of his marriage , and went in great state to bring the Queen , his wife , to the palace .
She made a magnificent <unk> into the capital with her two children , one on each side of her .
Some time afterwards , the King went to war with his neighbour , the <unk> <unk> .
He left the <unk> of the kingdom to the Queen , his mother , earnestly <unk> to her care his wife and his children .
He was likely to be all the summer in the field , and as soon as he was gone , the Queen-mother sent her daughter-in-law and the children to a country house in the wood , that she might more easily gratify her horrible longing .
She followed them thither a few days after , and said one evening to her Maître d &apos;Hôtel , &quot; I will eat little Aurora for dinner to-morrow . &quot;
&quot; Ah , Madam ! &quot;
exclaimed the Maître d &apos;Hôtel .
&quot; I will , &quot; said the Queen ( and she said it in the tone of an Ogress longing to eat fresh meat ) , &quot; and I will have her served up with _ sauce Robert _ .
&quot; &#91; 6 &#93; The poor man seeing plainly an Ogress was not to be <unk> with , took his great knife and went up to little Aurora &apos;s room .
She was then about four years old , and came jumping and laughing to throw her arms about his neck , and ask him for sweetmeats .
He burst into tears , the knife fell from his hands , and he went down again into the kitchen court and killed a little lamb , and served it up with so delicious a sauce , that his mistress assured him she had never eaten anything so excellent .
In the meanwhile , he had carried off little Aurora , and given her to his wife , to conceal her in the lodging which she occupied at the further end of the kitchen court .
A week afterwards , the wicked Queen said to her Maître d &apos;Hôtel , &quot; I will eat little Day for supper . &quot;
He made no reply , being determined to deceive her as before .
He went in search of little Day , and found him with a tiny <unk> in his hand , <unk> with a great monkey , though he was only three years old .
He carried him to his wife , who hid him where she had hidden his sister , and then <unk> a very tender little <unk> in the place of little Day , and which the Ogress thought wonderfully good .
All went well enough so far , but one evening this wicked Queen said to the Maître d &apos;Hôtel , &quot; I would eat the Queen with the same sauce that I had with her children . &quot;
Then , indeed , did the poor Maître d &apos;Hôtel despair of being again able to deceive her .
The young Queen was turned of twenty , without <unk> the hundred years she had slept ; her skin was a little <unk> , though it was white and beautiful , and where was he to find in the <unk> an animal that would pass for her .
He resolved that , to save his own life , he would cut the Queen &apos;s throat , and went up to her apartment with the determination to execute his purpose at once .
He <unk> himself up into a passion , and entered the young Queen &apos;s chamber poniard in hand .
He would not , however , take her by surprise , but repeated , very respectfully , the order he had received from the Queen-mother .
&quot; Do it !
do it ! &quot;
said she , stretching out her neck to him .
&quot; <unk> the order that has been given to you .
I shall again behold my children , my poor children , that I loved so dearly . &quot;
She had imagined them to be dead ever since they had been carried off without explanation .
&quot; No , no , Madam ! &quot;
replied the poor Maître d &apos;Hôtel , touched to the <unk> , &quot; you shall not die , and you shall see your children again , but it shall be in my own house , where I have hidden them ; and I will again deceive the Queen-mother by <unk> up to her a young hind in your <unk> . &quot;
He led her <unk> to his own apartments , where leaving her to embrace her children and weep with them , he went and <unk> a hind , of which the Queen ate at her supper , with as much appetite as if it had been the young Queen .
She <unk> in her cruelty , and intended to tell the King , on his return , that some ferocious wolves had devoured the Queen his wife , and her two children .
One evening that she was <unk> , as usual , round the <unk> and poultry <unk> of the Castle , to <unk> the smell of raw <unk> , she overheard little Day crying in a lower room , because the Queen , his mother , was about to whip him for having been naughty , and she also heard little Aurora begging forgiveness for her brother .
The Ogress recognised the voices of the Queen and her children , and , furious at having been <unk> , she gave orders , in a tone that made everybody tremble , that the next morning early there should be brought into the middle of the court a large copper , which she had filled with <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and serpents , in order to fling into it the Queen , her children , the Maître d &apos;Hôtel , his wife , and his maid servant .
She had commanded that they should be brought thither with hands tied behind them .
There they stood , and the <unk> were <unk> to fling them into the copper , when the King , who was not expected so early , entered the court-yard on horseback .
He had ridden post , and in great astonishment inquired what was the meaning of that horrible spectacle ?
Nobody dared to tell him , when the Ogress , enraged at the sight of the King &apos;s return , flung herself head <unk> into the copper , and was devoured in an instant by the horrid <unk> she had caused it to be filled with .
The King could not help being sorry for it ; she was his mother , but he speedily consoled himself in the society of his beautiful wife and children .
Some time for a husband to wait Who is young , handsome , <unk> , and tender , May not be a <unk> too great For a maid whom love happy would render .
But to be for a century bound To live single , I fancy the number Of <unk> but small would be found So long who could patiently slumber .
To lovers who hate time to <unk> , And minutes as centuries measure , I would hint , Those who marry in haste May live to repent it at leisure .
Yet so ardently <unk> they press , And on prudence so <unk> <unk> , That I <unk> &apos;t the heart , I confess , To urge on them Beauty &apos;s example .

MASTER CAT ; OR , PUSS IN BOOTS .
A <unk> <unk> to his three sons all his <unk> <unk> , which consisted only of his <unk> , his ass , and his cat .
The <unk> was speedily made .
Neither <unk> nor <unk> were called in ; they would soon have eaten up all the little <unk> .
The eldest had the <unk> ; the second son , the ass ; and the youngest had nothing but the cat .
The latter was <unk> at <unk> so poor a portion .
&quot; My brothers , &quot; said he , &quot; may <unk> an honest livelihood by entering into <unk> ; but , as for me , when I have eaten my Cat , and made a <unk> of his skin , I must die of hunger . &quot;
The Cat , who had heard this speech , but without appearing to do so , said to him , with a <unk> and serious air , &quot; Do not afflict yourself , master ; you have only to give me a bag and get a pair of boots made for me , to go amongst the <unk> in , and you will see that you are not so <unk> left as you believe . &quot;
<unk> the Cat &apos;s master did not place much confidence in this assertion , he had seen him play such cunning tricks in <unk> rats and mice , when he would <unk> himself up by the <unk> , or lie in the <unk> as if he were dead , that he was not altogether <unk> of being assisted by him in his distress .
As soon as the Cat had what he asked for , he pulled on his boots boldly , and hanging the bag round his neck , he took the strings of it in his <unk> <unk> , and went into a <unk> where there were a great number of rabbits .
He put some <unk> and some <unk> in his bag , and stretching himself out as if he were dead , he waited till some young rabbit , little <unk> in the <unk> of the world , should come and <unk> himself in the bag , in order to eat what he had put into it .
He had hardly laid down before he was gratified .
A young <unk> of a rabbit entered the bag , and Master Cat instantly pulling the strings , caught it and killed it without mercy .
<unk> of his prey , he went to the King &apos;s Palace , and demanded an audience .
He was <unk> up to his Majesty &apos;s apartment , into which having entered , he made a low bow to the King , and said to him , &quot; Sire , here is a wild rabbit , which my Lord the Marquis de Carabas ( such was the name he took a fancy to give to his master ) has ordered me to present , with his duty , to your Majesty . &quot;
&quot; Tell your master , &quot; replied the King , &quot; that I thank him , and that he has given me great pleasure . &quot;
Another day he went and hid himself in the <unk> , holding the mouth of his bag open , as usual , and as soon as a brace of partridges entered it , he pulled the strings , and took them both .
He went immediately and presented them to the King , in the same way that he had the wild rabbit .
The King received with equal gratification the brace of partridges , and gave him something to drink his health .
The Cat continued in this manner during two or three months to carry to the King , every now and then , presents of game from his master .
One day when he knew the King was going to drive on the banks of the river , with his daughter , the most beautiful Princess in the world , he said to his master , &quot; If you will follow my advice , your fortune is made ; you have only to go and bathe in a part of the river I will point out to you , and leave the rest to me . &quot;
The Marquis de Carabas did as his cat advised him , without knowing what good would come of it .
While he was bathing , the King passed by , and the Cat began to <unk> with all his might , &quot; <unk> !
help !
My Lord the Marquis de Carabas is <unk> ! &quot;
At this cry , the King looked out of the coach window , and recognising the cat who had so often brought game to him , ordered his guards to fly to the help of my Lord the Marquis de Carabas .
Whilst they were getting the poor Marquis out of the river , the Cat approaching the royal coach , told the King that during the time his master was bathing , some <unk> had come and carried off his clothes , although he had called &quot; <unk> ! &quot;
as loud as he could .
The <unk> had hidden them himself under a great stone .
The King immediately ordered the officers of his wardrobe to go and fetch one of his handsomest <unk> for my Lord the Marquis de Carabas .
The King embraced him a thousand times , and as the fine clothes they dressed him in set off his good looks ( for he was handsome and well made ) , the King &apos;s daughter found him much to her taste ; and the Marquis de Carabas had no sooner cast upon her two or three respectful and rather tender glances , than she fell desperately in love with him .
The King insisted upon his getting into the coach , and accompanying them in their drive .
The Cat , enchanted to see that his scheme began to succeed , ran on before , and having met with some peasants who were mowing a meadow , said to them , &quot; You , good people , who are mowing here , if you do not tell the King that the meadow you are mowing belongs to my Lord the Marquis de Carabas , you shall be all cut into pieces as small as <unk> meat ! &quot;
The King failed not to ask the <unk> whose meadow it was they were mowing ?
&quot; It belongs to my Lord the Marquis de Carabas , &quot; said they altogether , for the Cat &apos;s threat had frightened them .
&quot; You perceive , Sire , &quot; rejoined the Marquis , &quot; it is a meadow which <unk> an <unk> <unk> every year . &quot;
Master Cat , who kept in advance of the party , came up to some <unk> , and said to them , &quot; You , good people , who are <unk> , if you do not say that all this <unk> belongs to my Lord the Marquis de Carabas , you shall be all cut into pieces as small as <unk> meat ! &quot;
The King , who passed by a minute afterwards , wished to know to whom all those <unk> belonged that he saw there .
&quot; To my Lord the Marquis de Carabas , &quot; repeated the <unk> , and the King again wished the Marquis joy of his property .
The Cat , who ran before the coach , uttered the same threat to all he met with , and the King was astonished at the great wealth of my Lord the Marquis de Carabas .
Master Cat at length arrived at a fine Château , the owner of which was an Ogre , the richest that was ever known , for all the lands through which the King had driven were held of the Lord of this Château .
The Cat took care to inquire who the Ogre was , and what he was able to do ; and then requested to speak with him , saying that he would not pass so near his Château without doing himself the honour of paying his respects to him .
The Ogre received him as <unk> as an Ogre could , and made him sit down .
&quot; They assure me , &quot; said the Cat , &quot; that you possess the power of changing yourself into all sorts of animals ; that you could , for instance , <unk> yourself into a lion , or an elephant . &quot;
&quot; &apos; <unk> true , &quot; said the Ogre , <unk> , &quot; and to prove it to you , you shall see me become a lion . &quot;
The Cat was so frightened at seeing a lion before him , that he immediately <unk> up into the <unk> , not without trouble and danger , on account of his boots , which were not fit to walk on the <unk> with .
A short time afterwards , the Cat having perceived that the Ogre had resumed his previous form , descended , and admitted that he had been terribly frightened .
&quot; They assure me , besides , &quot; said the Cat , &quot; but I cannot believe it , that you have also the power to assume the form of the smallest animal ; for instance , to change yourself into a <unk> or a mouse .
I confess to you I hold that to be utterly impossible . &quot;
&quot; Impossible ! &quot;
replied the Ogre ; &quot; you shall see ! &quot;
and immediately changed himself into a mouse , which began to run about the floor .
The Cat no sooner caught sight of it than he <unk> upon and devoured it .
In the meanwhile , the King , who saw from the road the fine Château of the Ogre , desired to enter it .
The Cat , who heard the noise of the coach <unk> over the <unk> , ran to meet it , and said to the King , &quot; Your Majesty is <unk> to the Château of my Lord the Marquis de Carabas . &quot;
&quot; How , my Lord Marquis , &quot; exclaimed the King , &quot; this Château also belongs to you ?
Nothing can be finer than this court-yard , and all these <unk> that surround it .
Let us see the inside of it , if you please . &quot;
The Marquis handed out the young Princess , and following the King , who led the way upstairs , entered a grand hall , where they found a magnificent collation , which the Ogre had ordered to be prepared for some friends who were to have visited him that very day , but who did not presume to enter when they found the King was there .
The King , as much enchanted by the accomplishments of my Lord the Marquis de Carabas as his daughter , who <unk> upon him , and seeing the great wealth he possessed , said to him , after having drunk five or six <unk> , &quot; It depends entirely on yourself , my Lord Marquis , whether or not you become my son-in-law . &quot;
The Marquis , making several profound bows , accepted the honour the King offered him ; and on the same day was united to the Princess .
The Cat became a great lord , and never again ran after mice , except for his amusement .
Be the advantage ne &apos;er so great Of <unk> a superb <unk> , From sire to son descended .
Young men <unk> find , on <unk> , <unk> with ingenuity , They &apos;d better have depended .
<unk> If the son of a <unk> so quickly could gain The heart of a Princess , it seems pretty plain , With good looks and good manners , and some aid from dress , The <unk> need not quite despair of success .
CINDERELLA ; OR , THE LITTLE GLASS SLIPPER .
Once on a time there was a gentleman who took for a second wife the <unk> and proudest woman that had ever been seen .
She had two daughters of the same temper , and who resembled her in everything .
The husband , on his side , had a daughter , but whose gentleness and goodness were without <unk> .
She <unk> them from her mother , who was the best creature in the world .
The wedding was hardly over before the <unk> &apos;s ill-humour broke out .
She could not <unk> the young girl , whose good qualities made her own daughters appear more detestable .
She employed her in all the <unk> work of the house .
It was she who <unk> the plate , and the stairs , who <unk> Madame &apos;s chamber , and those of <unk> , her daughters .
She slept at the top of the house , in a <unk> , on a wretched straw <unk> , while her sisters occupied rooms , <unk> <unk> , in which were the most fashionable beds , and mirrors wherein they could see themselves from head to foot .
The poor girl bore everything with patience , and did not dare complain to her father , who would only have scolded her , as his wife governed him entirely .
When she had done her work , she went and placed herself in the <unk> , and sat down amongst the <unk> , which caused her to be called by the household in general Cindertail .
The second daughter , however , who was not so rude as her elder sister , called her Cinderella .
Notwithstanding , Cinderella , in her shabby clothes , looked a thousand times handsomer than her sisters , however magnificently attired .
It happened that the King &apos;s son gave a ball , and invited to it all persons of quality .
Our two young ladies were included in the invitation , for they cut a great figure in the neighbourhood .
Behold them in great delight , and very <unk> choosing the most becoming <unk> and head-dresses .
A new mortification for Cinderella , for it was she who <unk> her sisters &apos; linen , and set their <unk> .
Nothing was talked of but the style in which they were to be dressed .
&quot; I , &quot; said the eldest , &quot; will wear my red velvet dress and my English <unk> <unk> . &quot;
&quot; I , &quot; said the youngest , &quot; shall only wear my usual <unk> ; but to make up for that , I shall put on my <unk> <unk> , and my necklace of diamonds , which are none of the <unk> . &quot;
They sent for a good <unk> to make up their <unk> <unk> , and bought their patches of the best <unk> .
They called Cinderella to give them her opinion , for she had excellent taste .
Cinderella gave them the best advice in the world , and even offered to dress their heads for them , which they were very willing she should do ; and whilst she was about it , they said to her , &quot; Cinderella , shouldst thou like to go to the ball ? &quot;
&quot; Alas !
<unk> , you make game of me ; that would not <unk> me at all . &quot;
&quot; Thou art right , they would laugh immensely to see a Cindertail at a ball ! &quot;
<unk> other but Cinderella would have dressed their heads <unk> , but she was good <unk> , and dressed them to perfection .
They could eat nothing for nearly two days , so transported were they with joy .
More than a dozen <unk> were broken in making their <unk> as small as possible , and they were always before their <unk> .
At last the happy day arrived .
They set off , and Cinderella followed them with her eyes as long as she could .
When they were out of sight , she began to cry .
Her godmother , who saw her all in tears , inquired what <unk> her .
&quot; I should so <unk> should so <unk> &quot; she <unk> so much that she could not finish the sentence .
&quot; Thou wouldst so like to go to the <unk> not that it ? &quot;
&quot; Alas !
yes , &quot; said Cinderella , sighing .
&quot; Well , if thou wilt be a good girl , I will take care thou shalt go . &quot;
She led her into her chamber , and said to her , &quot; Go into the garden and bring me a pumpkin . &quot;
Cinderella went immediately , gathered the finest she could find , and brought it to her godmother , unable to <unk> how the pumpkin could enable her to go to the ball .
Her godmother <unk> it out ; and , having left nothing but the <unk> , struck it with her wand , and the pumpkin was immediately changed into a beautiful coach gilt all over .
She then went and looked into the <unk> , where she found six mice , all alive .
She told Cinderella to <unk> the door of the <unk> a little , and to each mouse , as it ran out , she gave a tap with her wand , and the mouse was immediately changed into a fine horse , thereby <unk> a handsome <unk> of six horses , of a beautiful <unk> <unk> colour .
As she was in some difficulty as to what she should make a coachman of , Cinderella said , &quot; I will go and see if there be not a <unk> in the <unk> ; we will make a coachman of him . &quot;
&quot; Thou art right , &quot; said her godmother .
&quot; Go and see . &quot;
Cinderella brought her the <unk> , in which there were three great rats .
The Fairy selected one from the three , on account of its ample beard , and having touched it , it was changed into a fat coachman , who had the finest <unk> that ever were seen .
She then said , &quot; Go into the garden , thou wilt find there , behind the <unk> , six <unk> , bring them to me . &quot;
She had no sooner brought them than the godmother transformed them into six footmen , who immediately jumped up behind the coach , with their <unk> all covered with <unk> , and hung on to it as if they had done nothing else all their lives .
The Fairy then said to Cinderella , &quot; Well , there is something to go to the ball in .
Art thou not well pleased ? &quot;
&quot; Yes ; but am I to go in these dirty clothes ? &quot;
Her godmother only touched her with her wand , and in the same instant her dress was changed to cloth of gold and silver , covered with jewels .
She then gave her a pair of glass slippers , the prettiest in the world .
When she was thus attired , she got into the coach ; but her godmother advised her , above all things , not to stay out past <unk> her , that if she remained at the ball one minute longer , her coach would again become a pumpkin ; her horses , mice ; her footmen , <unk> ; and her clothes resume their old appearance .
She promised her godmother she would not fail to leave the ball before midnight , and departed , out of her senses with joy .
The King &apos;s son , who was informed that a grand Princess had arrived whom nobody knew , ran to receive her .
He handed her out of the coach and led her into the hall , where the company was assembled .
There was immediately a dead silence ; they stopped dancing , and the <unk> ceased to play , so engrossed was every one in the contemplation of the great attractions of the unknown lady .
Nothing was heard but a low murmur of &quot; Oh !
how lovely she is ! &quot;
The King himself , old as he was , could not take his eyes from her , and observed to the Queen , that it was a long time since he had seen so beautiful and so amiable a person .
All the ladies were <unk> occupied in examining her head-dress and her clothes , that they might have some like them the very next day , provided they could find materials as beautiful , and <unk> sufficiently clever to make them up .
The King &apos;s son conducted her to the most honourable seat , and then led her out to dance .
She danced with so much grace that their admiration of her was increased .
A very grand supper was served , of which the Prince ate not a morsel , so absorbed was he in contemplation of her .
She seated herself beside her sisters , and showed them a thousand <unk> .
She shared with them the oranges and citrons which the Prince had given to her ; at which they were much surprised , for she appeared a perfect stranger to them .
Whilst they were in conversation together , Cinderella heard the clock <unk> <unk> past eleven .
She immediately made a profound curtsey to the company , and departed as quickly as she could .
As soon as she had reached home , she went to find her godmother ; and after having thanked her , said she much wished to go to the ball again the next day , because the King &apos;s son had invited her .
While she was occupied in telling her godmother all that had passed at the ball , the two sisters knocked at the door .
Cinderella went and opened <unk> &quot; How late you are ! &quot;
said she to them , <unk> , <unk> her eyes , and stretching herself as if she had but just awoke .
She had not , however , been inclined to sleep since she had left them .
&quot; <unk> thou been at the ball , &quot; said one of her sisters to her , &quot; thou wouldst not have been weary of it .
There came to it the most beautiful <unk> most beautiful that ever was seen .
She paid us a thousand attentions .
She gave us oranges and citrons . &quot;
Cinderella was beside herself with delight .
She asked them the name of the Princess ; but they replied that nobody knew her ; that the King &apos;s son was much <unk> about it , and that he would give everything in the world to know who she was .
Cinderella smiled and said , &quot; She was very handsome , then ?
Heavens !
how fortunate you are ! <unk> not I get a sight of her ?
Alas !
Mademoiselle <unk> , <unk> me the yellow gown you wear every day ? &quot;
&quot; Truly , &quot; said Mademoiselle <unk> , &quot; I like that !
<unk> one &apos;s gown to a dirty Cindertail like you ! --I must be very mad indeed ! &quot;
Cinderella fully expected this refusal , and was delighted at it , for she would have been greatly embarrassed if her sister had <unk> her her gown .
The next day the two sisters went to the ball , and Cinderella also , but still more <unk> dressed than before .
The King &apos;s son never left her side , or ceased saying tender things to her .
The young lady was much amused , and forgot what her godmother had advised her , so that she heard the clock begin to <unk> twelve when she did not even think it was eleven .
She rose and fled as lightly as a fawn .
The Prince followed her , but could not <unk> her .
She dropped one of her glass slippers , which the Prince carefully picked up .
Cinderella reached home almost <unk> , without coach or footmen , and in her shabby clothes , nothing having remained of all her <unk> , except one of her little slippers , the <unk> of that she had let fall .
The guards at the palace gate were asked if they had not seen a Princess go out ; they answered that they had seen no one pass but a <unk> girl , who had more the air of a peasant than of a lady .
When the two sisters returned from the ball , Cinderella asked them if they had been as much entertained as before , and if the beautiful lady had been present .
They said yes , but that she had fled as soon as it had struck twelve , and so precipitately that she had let fall one of her little glass slippers , the prettiest in the world ; that the King &apos;s son had picked it up ; that he had done nothing but gaze upon it during the remainder of the evening ; and that , undoubtedly , he was very much in love with the beautiful person to whom the little slipper belonged .
They spoke the truth ; for a few days afterwards the King &apos;s son caused it to be proclaimed by sound of <unk> that he would marry her whose foot would exactly <unk> with the slipper .
They began by trying it on the Princesses , then on the <unk> , and so on throughout all the Court ; but in vain .
It was taken to the two sisters , who did their utmost to force one of their feet into the slipper , but they could not manage to do so .
Cinderella , who witnessed their efforts and recognised the slipper , said , <unk> , &quot; Let me see if it will not fit me . &quot;
Her sisters began to laugh and ridicule her .
